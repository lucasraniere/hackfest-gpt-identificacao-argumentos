{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSalary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways\n\nIt is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.\nFirstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.\nSecondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. \nThirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.\nIn conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHigher education should be available only to good students or not\n\nNo one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.\nFirst of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.\nOn the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.\nIn conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDrivers have to pay a fee for driving in Rush Hour\n\nStarted in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. \nCapitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.\nBuying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.\nRather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. \nIn conclusion, \"rush hours\" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nno additional payment should be charged on them, with text span (470, 517)\ncharging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational, with text span (2347, 2425)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\n\"rush hours\" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers, with text span (2196, 2258)\ncharging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction, with text span (791, 856)\nCharging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous, with text span (1327, 1389)\ncharging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful, with text span (2078, 2178)\nRather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil, with text span (1568, 1855)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nCapitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them, with text span (552, 652)\nDriving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, with text span (654, 772)\ntraffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban, with text span (886, 956)\nit is out of drivers' control, with text span (961, 990)\nWars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries, with text span (1076, 1170)\nBuying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear, with text span (1172, 1325)\ncharging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights, with text span (1471, 1566)\nMajority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, with text span (1391, 1465)\nSometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways, with text span (1857, 1973)\nthe one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers, with text span (1991, 2064) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nI'm against providing more money to professors\n\nUniversity education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. \nTo begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.\nBesides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. \nAt school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nMoney should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors, with text span (358, 481)\nI against providing more money to professors, with text span (2365, 2409)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThe professors are essential, with text span (277, 305)\nthe school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors, with text span (530, 599)\nTo improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate, with text span (1526, 1612)\nStudents' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university, with text span (2239, 2340)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe schools are established for students, with text span (316, 356)\nthe most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively, with text span (609, 699)\nBy renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment, with text span (701, 798)\nA comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer, with text span (800, 859)\nstudents spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning, with text span (867, 940)\nstudents have a better environment to working on their assignments, with text span (958, 1024)\nthe quality of their assignments will improve, with text span (1028, 1073)\nthe competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation, with text span (1081, 1143)\nIn my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby, with text span (1145, 1217)\nI prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment, with text span (1227, 1312)\nIt's unpleasant to stay at school, with text span (1314, 1347)\ncoffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly, with text span (1358, 1445)\nthe ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better, with text span (1456, 1524)\nHigh-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money, with text span (1777, 1857)\nThere won't be any effect if school does so, with text span (1859, 1902)\nThere was news about raising professors' salary in my country, with text span (1904, 1965)\nThis event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly, with text span (1967, 2031)\nThe proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries, with text span (2033, 2103)\nif the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen, with text span (2121, 2202) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudy at home by using technology\/study or traditional school\n\nI don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. \nStudying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.\nFirst, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. \nSecond, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.\nFurthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. \nFor the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom, with text span (63, 127)\ndistance education can't replace traditional school, with text span (1832, 1883)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nStudying at home by using technology is convenient, with text span (151, 201)\nStudents may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects, with text span (786, 891)\nStudents may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision, with text span (1207, 1286)\nthere is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates, with text span (1398, 1499)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThe biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day, with text span (203, 291)\nyou could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course, with text span (306, 384)\nYou can study any time you want, with text span (386, 417)\nif you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home, with text span (428, 552)\nit may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help, with text span (908, 988)\nattending an education course at home requires persistence and patience, with text span (561, 632)\nwhen you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements, with text span (645, 784)\nIf you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you, with text span (1288, 1383)\nstudying at home is very different from traditional learning, with text span (999, 1059)\nUnlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates, with text span (1061, 1205)\nWe can learn a lot from programs at home, with text span (1501, 1541)\nour computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people, with text span (1552, 1624)\nstudents may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork, with text span (1639, 1704)\nStudying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities, with text span (1706, 1793) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDistance-learning cannot bring the benefits that traditional colleges offer\n \nWith the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.\nTo begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.\nBesides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.\nIt is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.\nIn conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents can acquire more benefits from the remote education, with text span (379, 439)\ndistance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose, with text span (1863, 2059)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntraditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future, with text span (1740, 1852)\nstudying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense, with text span (456, 527)\nlong-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches, with text span (862, 998)\ntraditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations, with text span (1346, 1460)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nStudents who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection, with text span (529, 679)\nThis especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line, with text span (681, 846)\nhe can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course, with text span (1237, 1322)\nA student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule, with text span (1137, 1233)\nPupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc, with text span (1000, 1135)\nThese make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities, with text span (1462, 1568)\nwith the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts, with text span (1574, 1708) END"}

However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.\nFirst of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.\nSecondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.\nIn sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSeveral languages are in danger of extinction\n\nIt is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.\nFirst and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.\nOn the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.\nIn a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nForeign language instruction should begin in kindergarten\n\nEducational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.\nTo begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. \nNevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYour job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does\n\nWith the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.\nAdmittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. \nHowever, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. \nSecond, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.\nIn conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nliving environment is more important than job for most of us, with text span (290, 350)\nit is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work, with text span (1951, 2034)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\njob can bring us happiness, with text span (364, 390)\njob can provide money to us, with text span (553, 580)\npeople should concern more about their living environment than job, with text span (592, 658)\nbeautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people, with text span (1108, 1221)\nthe goal people is for good livers, with text span (2041, 2075)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nPeople can receive a sense of values and respected from job, with text span (392, 451)\nIf people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence, with text span (453, 538)\nfor most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives, with text span (667, 723)\nFew people can feel happiness from their job, with text span (725, 769)\nthey have to continue to work more than 30 years, with text span (778, 826)\nWorkers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day, with text span (841, 971)\nThese labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness, with text span (973, 1037)\nthey feel tired and frustrated after long hour work, with text span (1046, 1097)\nWithout beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety, with text span (1223, 1313)\nNowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly, with text span (1315, 1409)\nFactories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil, with text span (1411, 1474)\nIn order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests, with text span (1476, 1539)\nIn China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick, with text span (1541, 1617)\nthese factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people, with text span (1626, 1713)\nlocal residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, with text span (1727, 1823)\nthey cannot feel happiness from high-paying job, with text span (1825, 1872)\nmost of them suffer from cancer or other diseases, with text span (1885, 1934) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nI believe it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community\n\nI believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.\nIn the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.\nFurthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.\nLastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community, with text span (94, 161)\nI advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community, with text span (1775, 1878)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\na large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time, with text span (779, 870)\nit not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs, with text span (885, 948)\nit is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand, with text span (1259, 1371)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping, with text span (213, 323)\nQueens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose, with text span (353, 562)\nit is one of the most productive malls in New York, with text span (590, 640)\nI could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there, with text span (655, 751)\nThere may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall, with text span (950, 1053)\nIt could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job, with text span (1055, 1147)\nSome students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money, with text span (1149, 1249)\nThere may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers, with text span (1373, 1482)\nwith sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy, with text span (1497, 1604)\nthe residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes, with text span (1619, 1740) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues\n\nIn today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.\nThe second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.\nIn conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being, with text span (1619, 1812)\ngovernments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions, with text span (274, 387)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsociety should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients, with text span (736, 944)\ngovernments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society, with text span (968, 1095)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\neducation and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system, with text span (410, 524)\ndecreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients, with text span (541, 723)\nthere is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health, with text span (1112, 1220)\na government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives, with text span (1233, 1388)\nthe marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign, with text span (1403, 1602) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEducation plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country\n\nEducation is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.\nIn a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.\nDevelopment through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.\nIn conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhat is a very important skill a person should learn\n\nSome people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. \nStress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.\nIn the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.\nFurthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.\nFor the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress, with text span (1939, 2045)\nstress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have, with text span (179, 283)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nif we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems, with text span (613, 699)\nstress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization, with text span (1146, 1224)\nit is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body, with text span (1607, 1712)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nStress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences, with text span (307, 413)\nStress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success, with text span (415, 473)\nit is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals, with text span (484, 598)\nSome people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best, with text span (933, 1040)\nother people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems, with text span (1042, 1133)\nIn the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload, with text span (701, 931)\nsome people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches, with text span (1446, 1512)\nMelancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide, with text span (1514, 1591)\nstress takes a toll on our health, with text span (1239, 1272)\nThis is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress, with text span (1365, 1438)\nIt is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands, with text span (1274, 1363) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nProtect animals or not?\n \nMany animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.\nAnimal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.\nHowever, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.\nFurthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.\nIn conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwe should give priority to our own issues, with text span (260, 301)\nmore emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction, with text span (1524, 1669)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible, with text span (605, 678)\nspecies extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution, with text span (697, 769)\nWe should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species, with text span (1393, 1507)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nbiodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem, with text span (368, 430)\nIf certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat, with text span (432, 592)\nThe environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being, with text span (771, 871)\nA great number of plants and animals died out, with text span (873, 918)\nthey were unable to fit into the new environment, with text span (927, 975)\nthe process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it, with text span (996, 1083)\nhuman beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars, with text span (1098, 1198)\nWhen these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help, with text span (1200, 1391) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nProhibit public smoking?\n\nThe awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.\nFirstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.\nSecondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafes, hospital and shopping street.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEarly retirement for 55+ employees to help younger people\n\nNowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.\nAdmittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.\nHowever, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.\nIn conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly, with text span (1798, 1927)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nencouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits, with text span (361, 480)\nthe introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, with text span (1716, 1774)\nsacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences, with text span (1002, 1092)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities, with text span (633, 724)\nfresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation, with text span (491, 615)\nhaving a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency, with text span (736, 833)\nCompared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline, with text span (835, 991)\nFrom social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government, with text span (1376, 1496)\nsufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently, with text span (1511, 1687)\nFrom personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations, with text span (1094, 1189)\nevery person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity, with text span (1213, 1374) END"}

Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.\nStudying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all.

Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.\nOf course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.\nMoreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his\/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIncreased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars?\n\nThere is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.\nOne can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.\nHowever, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.\nAnother point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.\nTo summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nWhile many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion, with text span (302, 430)\nit disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars, with text span (1651, 1818)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nhigher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons, with text span (1587, 1640)\nTaxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries, with text span (557, 692)\npeople have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis, with text span (1050, 1165)\ncountries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially, with text span (1218, 1317)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nif petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile, with text span (463, 555)\nfor those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities, with text span (708, 837)\nthe more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable, with text span (936, 1034)\ntaxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation, with text span (848, 919)\nSuppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them, with text span (1319, 1464)\nAmerica, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil, with text span (1466, 1571) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIs a break good or bad after high school for students\n\nStudies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.\nIn most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.\nNevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.\nHowever, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.\nImportantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school, with text span (267, 345)\na break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies, with text span (2104, 2205)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them, with text span (2009, 2096)\na break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies, with text span (648, 750)\nWorking or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest, with text span (1000, 1100)\nA break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental, with text span (1393, 1456)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge, with text span (765, 890)\nA relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change, with text span (443, 521)\nA continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions, with text span (523, 634)\nIt will also help them to learn professional setup by working, with text span (1102, 1163)\nFinancially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job, with text span (1165, 1263)\nSome students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course, with text span (1265, 1352)\nStudents can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time, with text span (1765, 1830)\nWhen students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia, with text span (1458, 1598)\nmy cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted, with text span (1614, 1702)\nWhen he started his university studies, he failed miserably, with text span (1704, 1763)\nA break gives students more benefits than harms, with text span (1947, 1994)\nIt varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period, with text span (1876, 1945) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIt is not necessary for university students to attend classes\n\nThough out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. \nFirstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.\nSecondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.\nAdmittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.\nAll in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam, with text span (400, 482)\nthe university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test, with text span (2121, 2215)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nnot only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated, with text span (2224, 2359)\nthe students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject, with text span (537, 602)\nthe university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not, with text span (1874, 2023)\nif the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated, with text span (1253, 1392)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nI don't like electronics, with text span (637, 661)\nelectronics cannot always be seen in the real world, with text span (671, 722)\nAnd I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics, with text span (724, 786)\nBut I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics, with text span (788, 861)\nAnd if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again, with text span (863, 1025)\nLuckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach, with text span (1027, 1115)\nAnd I can study physics without consideration of my electronics, with text span (1117, 1180)\nAnd at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam, with text span (1182, 1241)\nthe benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points, with text span (2029, 2107)\nIf one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes, with text span (1394, 1489)\nAnd the students will have nothing to do in the campus, with text span (1491, 1545)\nhe or she will play online games days and nights, with text span (1552, 1600)\nThe academic achievement will decline, with text span (1602, 1639)\nthis student will become a loser in the world, with text span (1653, 1698)\nAnd all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class, with text span (1700, 1780)\nThis is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system, with text span (1782, 1860) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nshould one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style?\n\nWith increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.\nThis is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.\nFurthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.\nDespite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.\nWith those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes.

One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.\nFirst of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.\nAnother way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.\nFinally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. \nAs I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nTelevision has destroyed communication among friends and family, with text span (249, 312)\ntelevision has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television, with text span (1901, 2072)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nSome People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority, with text span (314, 449)\ntelevision is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, with text span (1807, 1882)\nsome people spend a lot of time watching television, with text span (465, 516)\nAnother way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family, with text span (1036, 1168)\nsome people make the television a priority, with text span (1549, 1591)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nshe is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email, with text span (866, 929)\nSometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials, with text span (760, 860)\nInstead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours, with text span (518, 603)\nTime with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them, with text span (931, 1034)\nI know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours, with text span (605, 758)\nThis is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns, with text span (1170, 1283)\nwhen there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation, with text span (1291, 1372)\nthe television is again in between them, with text span (1381, 1420)\nWhen family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases, with text span (1422, 1538)\nI remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night, with text span (1593, 1731) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhy should human beings travel to outer space?\n\nFor many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.\nFirstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.\nSecondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.\nFinally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.\nAs a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nhuman beings should travel to outer space, with text span (1542, 1583)\nthere are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space, with text span (437, 501)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmany facts about solar system can be discovered, with text span (512, 559)\npeople can know more about the planet earth itself, with text span (810, 860)\na great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented, with text span (1101, 1157)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\na picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat, with text span (575, 641)\nit is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa, with text span (667, 724)\nIf it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts, with text span (726, 798)\nBy observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth, with text span (862, 991)\nWith this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming, with text span (993, 1090)\nAs astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks, with text span (1159, 1308)\nOxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater, with text span (1310, 1399)\nspaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society, with text span (1411, 1499) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nE-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face\n\nTechnology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.\nEveryone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.\nIn addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.\nLast but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. \nOn the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating, with text span (270, 363)\ne-mail is the greatest way for major people to use, with text span (1997, 2047)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ne-mail has been a great way of communication, with text span (386, 430)\nwriting e-mail helps people express honestly, with text span (816, 860)\nE-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive, with text span (1855, 1919)\nIts convenience saves our time, with text span (2049, 2079)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nYou can talk to others from thousands mile, with text span (432, 474)\nif you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact, with text span (490, 610)\nWe will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address, with text span (612, 686)\nIf the address is wrong, then you will know right away, with text span (688, 742)\ne-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click, with text span (754, 801)\ne-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out, with text span (1165, 1212)\nthe face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid, with text span (885, 937)\nSometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect, with text span (939, 1005)\nI want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do, with text span (1021, 1152)\nShe will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed, with text span (1214, 1302)\nI don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive, with text span (1304, 1387)\nevery communication needs fluency, with text span (1409, 1442)\npeople can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time, with text span (1446, 1518)\nVoice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident, with text span (1520, 1615)\nwhen I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively, with text span (1630, 1708)\nThey may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say, with text span (1710, 1798)\nAnyone can meet this problem once in any conversation, with text span (1800, 1853) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe Internet is an adequate source of academic information\n\nOver the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.\nFirst and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.\nIn the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.\nCritics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.\nAfter analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning, with text span (536, 608)\nI would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process, with text span (2279, 2354)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils, with text span (630, 751)\nthe Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, with text span (1502, 1569)\nthe Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs, with text span (1851, 1979)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nNowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace, with text span (753, 902)\nthe Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever, with text span (913, 978)\nwith the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance, with text span (990, 1068)\nCollege students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries, with text span (1070, 1220)\nthe Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying, with text span (1242, 1311)\nWhile virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query, with text span (1313, 1480)\nThis fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances, with text span (1748, 1826)\nHave you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously, with text span (1619, 1746)\nthese problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself, with text span (2018, 2126)\nwhat we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study, with text span (2134, 2240) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhy people visit museums?\n\nAs a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.\nPrimary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.\nSecondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould teenagers learn all school subjects\/focus on one subject\n\nPresently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.\nThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.\nThose who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.\nIt is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI do support the view of learning all school subjects, with text span (2002, 2055)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nconcentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future, with text span (1827, 1989)\nThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized, with text span (475, 546)\nthis education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness, with text span (1235, 1353)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwith some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future, with text span (568, 691)\nTeenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate, with text span (693, 777)\nIn students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes, with text span (779, 926)\nstill many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done, with text span (937, 1080)\nmost students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs, with text span (1091, 1177)\nstudents can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects, with text span (1380, 1476)\nunder such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study, with text span (1564, 1725)\nthe dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study, with text span (1737, 1803) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHow teachers can make the subject interesting to students!\n\nThere are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.\nFirst of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.\nSecond, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.\nIn conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school, with text span (340, 491)\nusing life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, with text span (1977, 2137)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own, with text span (2156, 2276)\nby explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject, with text span (507, 697)\nby bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving, with text span (1431, 1592)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTake chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class, with text span (699, 1000)\nWhile I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas, with text span (1002, 1204)\nThis type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good, with text span (1206, 1282)\nI connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore, with text span (1284, 1421)\nThis will address students' interests, with text span (1594, 1631)\nit's the assignment that needs real life participation, with text span (1640, 1694)\nin law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them, with text span (1709, 1863)\nWhen any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react, with text span (1865, 1960) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLearning a foreign language in my own country or another country\n\nKnowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.\nSecondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould the Government Provide Free College?\n\nSome people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. \nFirst, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. \nSecond, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.\nThird, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. \nIn short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice.

From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.\nFirst of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUsing animals for the benefit of the human beings\n\nWith the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.\nFirst of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.\nThough animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould high school make music lessons compulsory\n\nMost people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.\nIt is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.\nBy contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.\nIn conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nAn integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory, with text span (1999, 2093)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmusic can help an individual to shape its character, with text span (1946, 1997)\nmany university authorities provide music lessons for their students, with text span (387, 455)\nmusic and other entertaining subjects should be optional, with text span (1528, 1584)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey live and study in a harmony with music, with text span (464, 507)\nIt is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology, with text span (267, 374)\nstudents, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time, with text span (535, 695)\nmusic can be a useful and interesting solution, with text span (711, 757)\nif musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life, with text span (769, 934)\nstudents with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music, with text span (945, 1024)\nthe calm atmosphere in the class might be created, with text span (1040, 1089)\nit is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students, with text span (1104, 1179)\nNowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace, with text span (1586, 1655)\nstudents are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song, with text span (1669, 1807)\nstudents can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously, with text span (1426, 1515)\nmusic is the art which requires special attitude towards it, with text span (1343, 1402)\ndemand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees, with text span (1210, 1299) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOveremphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media\n\nAs a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:\nIt is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.\nFirst of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.\nFurthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.\nBased on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nmedia is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society, with text span (123, 206)\ndisadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages, with text span (229, 329)\npaying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem, with text span (1601, 1686)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmedia provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people, with text span (389, 499)\nsensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems, with text span (1109, 1175)\ngossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion, with text span (790, 894)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThe most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip, with text span (501, 591)\njournalism is changing, with text span (602, 624)\nSome reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people, with text span (626, 774)\nthese personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society, with text span (1291, 1425)\nyellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues, with text span (1443, 1550)\nThe media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience, with text span (1177, 1283)\nThe audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story, with text span (896, 984)\nit is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported, with text span (996, 1094) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTraditional games or modern games in developing children's skills\n\nGames have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.\nIt is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.\nHowever, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.\nFurthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.\nThus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nparents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games, with text span (414, 486)\ntraditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games, with text span (2167, 2272)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nOnly through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process, with text span (2274, 2375)\nmodern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend, with text span (504, 660)\ntraditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society, with text span (1038, 1184)\nit is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today, with text span (1602, 1683)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nchildren have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future, with text span (678, 860)\nchildren have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative, with text span (880, 1019)\nOne primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills, with text span (1186, 1276)\nUnlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face, with text span (1278, 1485)\ncommunicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more, with text span (1500, 1587)\nthese traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices, with text span (1694, 1869)\nmodern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits, with text span (1884, 1955)\nthere is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival, with text span (1968, 2137) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless\n\nUnemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.\nGovernment money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.\nAlso, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.\nOf course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.\nIn conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out, with text span (189, 291)\ndirect financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity, with text span (1519, 1633)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, with text span (1454, 1517)\nGovernment money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only, with text span (293, 362)\nto survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well, with text span (706, 790)\nthis does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance, with text span (920, 989)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTax revenue is collected from those who works, with text span (364, 409)\nSpending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers, with text span (411, 509)\nthere are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, with text span (520, 625)\naddressing unemployment should have low priority, with text span (630, 678)\nIf they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all, with text span (792, 907)\nit is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again, with text span (1315, 1402)\nThey are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support, with text span (991, 1128)\nthe government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work, with text span (1144, 1302) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe car use will definitely decrease in twenty years\n\nViews differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.\nFirst of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. \nSecond, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.\nAlthough, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.\nIn conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthere will be a decrease in cars use in the future, with text span (501, 551)\nthe car use will definitely decrease in twenty years, with text span (2294, 2346)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is much convenience to take a subway or a bus, with text span (659, 707)\nwith the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not, with text span (1017, 1130)\na personal car uses is in need, with text span (1542, 1572)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe public transportation has improved, with text span (619, 657)\nI live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars, with text span (722, 827)\nwith the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own, with text span (833, 935)\na driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world, with text span (946, 1011)\ninstead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city, with text span (1145, 1314)\na public transportation can't meet every place, with text span (1581, 1627)\nit may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places, with text span (1640, 1729)\nno matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet, with text span (1740, 1933)\nIt not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health, with text span (1935, 2008)\nthis won't be a problem at all, with text span (2023, 2053) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould all the advertisements be banned?\n\nNever in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.\nFirst, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.\nBesides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.\nThat is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.\nTaken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwhile some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring, with text span (343, 435)\nadvertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth, with text span (1452, 1531)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring, with text span (444, 537)\npublicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies, with text span (744, 837)\nthe advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies, with text span (1221, 1382)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor, with text span (548, 714)\nit could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country, with text span (858, 962)\nA recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic, with text span (964, 1140)\nits merits still outweigh these downsides, with text span (1389, 1430) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPolice force carries guns - significant impact for level of violence\n\nThe increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.\nFirst of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.\nSecondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.\nIn conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthis trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society, with text span (287, 357)\nit will bring the higher level of violence, with text span (1589, 1631)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nbeing armed with guns in the police force is necessary, with text span (1533, 1587)\na society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one, with text span (1064, 1156)\nThose are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence, with text span (1385, 1485)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwe need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself, with text span (498, 642)\ncriminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs, with text span (657, 820)\ncitizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally, with text span (828, 906)\nwhile on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns, with text span (918, 1051)\npeople and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson, with text span (1231, 1372)\npolice force carries guns only in high crime societies, with text span (1168, 1222) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould students be taught to compete or to cooperate?\n\nIt is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.\nFirst of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.\nOn the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.\nConsequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwe should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education, with text span (503, 575)\na more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success, with text span (2154, 2231)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthrough cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students, with text span (591, 714)\ncompetition makes the society more effective, with text span (1332, 1376)\nwithout the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition, with text span (1927, 1992)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWhat we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others, with text span (716, 851)\nDuring the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred, with text span (853, 1086)\nAll of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life, with text span (1088, 1191)\nthe significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory, with text span (1212, 1301)\nwhen we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation, with text span (1387, 1492)\nTake Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care, with text span (1549, 1846) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nClassmates' impacts on children's performance at school\n\nIt goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.\nTo begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.\nTo add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.\nAll advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements, with text span (324, 416)\nclassmates are unrivalled by the children's parents, with text span (1574, 1625)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school, with text span (1629, 1756)\nthe classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children, with text span (433, 516)\nwhen it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none, with text span (990, 1075)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIn high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same, with text span (518, 746)\nFrom a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances, with text span (748, 977)\nstudents share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others, with text span (1105, 1231)\nit can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents, with text span (1233, 1355)\nSharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension, with text span (1357, 1545) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPhysical exercise\n\nAlthough some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. \nFirst of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: \"Anima sana in corpore sano\", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.\nBesides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. \nLast, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.\nIn the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe physical education part should not be outweighed, with text span (147, 199)\nthe more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students, with text span (2111, 2240)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nPhysical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country, with text span (201, 350)\nif the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation, with text span (795, 938)\nwhen we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer, with text span (949, 1027)\nfinancial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is, with text span (1470, 1554)\nputting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society, with text span (1897, 2007)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nhealthy body is basis for healthy soul, with text span (446, 484)\nThere is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises, with text span (486, 581)\nThe more we practice, the better we feel, with text span (583, 623)\nthere is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better, with text span (639, 789)\nwhen a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation, with text span (1042, 1147)\nthe school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically, with text span (1156, 1322)\nalmost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education, with text span (1337, 1446)\nthe money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, with text span (1570, 1657)\nthe nation is comparatively healthy, with text span (1665, 1700)\nphysically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development, with text span (1719, 1808)\nthe better a person feels, the better his brain works, with text span (1831, 1884)\nit ends up with financially competitive country, with text span (2018, 2065) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it\n\nNowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.\nFirst, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. \nSecond, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.\nThird, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.\nIn conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nparents should encourage students to take the part-time job, with text span (2247, 2306)\nit is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs, with text span (217, 282)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntaking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it, with text span (2139, 2234)\nthey can teach students many things about adult life, with text span (601, 653)\nwe need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be, with text span (1399, 1468)\nthe part-time job can make people understand future life better, with text span (1751, 1814)\nthe part-time job will effect student' study, with text span (1852, 1896)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmost people they contact with are also students, with text span (436, 483)\nthere are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university, with text span (335, 426)\nwhen students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults, with text span (494, 595)\nMy friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it, with text span (655, 742)\nThrough part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life, with text span (744, 873)\nLisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work, with text span (888, 1058)\nthanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life, with text span (1067, 1177)\nwe do not experience it, with text span (1287, 1310)\nit is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be, with text span (1312, 1386)\nsome questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job, with text span (1480, 1738)\nparents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life, with text span (1188, 1268)\nmost students will do the part-time job in their holiday, with text span (1908, 1964)\nit will not effect on their study, with text span (1969, 2002)\nCompared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday, with text span (2004, 2122) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nType of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone\n\nStudy achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.\nTo begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.\nFurthermore\/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternet will end the era of newspapers and magazines\n\nDigital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.\nA very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.\nPeople often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.\nTo conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\n\"Pen and Paper\" Examination\n\nExaminations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.\nThere are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.\nA number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.\nIn conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nexams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement, with text span (1531, 1615)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nexams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system, with text span (1626, 1776)\nThere are clearly advantages to exams, with text span (349, 386)\nexams also have some drawbacks, with text span (656, 686)\nA number of measures should be taken to address these concerns, with text span (1050, 1112)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThey help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates, with text span (388, 471)\nThey are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability, with text span (473, 645)\nTest-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills, with text span (688, 791)\nsome test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety, with text span (806, 884)\nteachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all, with text span (900, 1048)\nexams should match the content and activities of the learning environment, with text span (1133, 1206)\nExam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills, with text span (1208, 1306)\nOther types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability, with text span (1308, 1492) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWorking at home vs Working in a company\n\nDue to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.\nFirst of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he\/she can assemble his\/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one's computer or Internet has any breakdown, he\/she can call the MIS staff to fix.\nSecond, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.\nIn conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nworking at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office, with text span (407, 477)\nworking in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency, with text span (1531, 1616)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nwhile working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly, with text span (493, 571)\nworking at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works, with text span (1001, 1088)\nIt not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home, with text span (1618, 1778)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThink about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he\/she can assemble his\/her colleges right away and discuss, with text span (648, 815)\nThey can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together, with text span (573, 646)\nIt's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone, with text span (817, 883)\nif one's computer or Internet has any breakdown, he\/she can call the MIS staff to fix, with text span (906, 991)\npeople are easily distracted while working at home, with text span (1103, 1153)\nIt's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away, with text span (1155, 1250)\nwhile people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing, with text span (1265, 1371)\npeople who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss, with text span (1383, 1514) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWay to reduce the amount of traffic?\n\nBig cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.\nFirst of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.\nSecond, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.\nIn conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncity planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas, with text span (1556, 1648)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npublic transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street, with text span (458, 539)\nThe city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people, with text span (1441, 1539)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nBuses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options, with text span (541, 676)\na bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number, with text span (690, 802)\nthey will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays, with text span (952, 1010)\nNot to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles, with text span (804, 940)\nhuge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities, with text span (1282, 1439)\nif some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now, with text span (1099, 1260) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThere will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms\n\nIn recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.\nThere are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.\nSecondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm - the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.\nIn conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers, with text span (171, 294)\nthere can be no school without a teacher, with text span (1627, 1667)\ncomputers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place, with text span (1682, 1790)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nTeachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs, with text span (1792, 1862)\ncomputers need to be operated by people, with text span (381, 420)\nchildren need human interactions, with text span (963, 995)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch, with text span (867, 951)\nscientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching, with text span (671, 785)\nlessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector, with text span (520, 660)\nNo one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today, with text span (422, 505)\nAs a recent interview with Josh Trumm - the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper educatio, with text span (1119, 1383)\nWithout someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn', with text span (1386, 1478)\nonly a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model, with text span (1538, 1610)\nNo matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils, with text span (997, 1117) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time\n\nNowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.\nFirstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.\nIn addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.\nFinally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.\nIn conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncars have improved modern life, with text span (319, 349)\nTravelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car, with text span (2335, 2500)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ncars cause a lot of pollution, with text span (2223, 2252)\nMany people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances, with text span (521, 592)\ncars increase the chance of employment, with text span (1086, 1124)\npeople who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world, with text span (2060, 2150)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life, with text span (2261, 2333)\nthey can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle, with text span (601, 659)\nmy car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city, with text span (703, 810)\nI was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away, with text span (812, 892)\nThanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today, with text span (894, 985)\nWithout my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship, with text span (987, 1071)\npeople are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages, with text span (381, 489)\npeople are able to drive to work and can work further away from home, with text span (1133, 1201)\nthey are more flexible, with text span (1216, 1238)\nMy father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money, with text span (1240, 1342)\nHe used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend, with text span (1344, 1460)\nIf he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms, with text span (1462, 1627)\nthe automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world, with text span (1638, 1718)\nIf people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life, with text span (1720, 1817)\nThey are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas, with text span (1819, 1905)\nThere are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car, with text span (1907, 2045) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEducated high-school students with bright and independent mind\n\nHigh school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.\nFirst of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.\nNext, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.\nLastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she\/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.\nIn conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life?\n\nThere is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.\nIt is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.\nIn tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.\nTo sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPart time job for teenage students\n\nWhen we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he\/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.\nThe main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.\nAnother reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.\nIn sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe option to work or study from home is advantage or disadvantage\n\nUndoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.\nOn the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.\nOn the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.\nFollowing both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks, with text span (1630, 1724)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious, with text span (998, 1076)\nThese factors affect people who work or study from home, with text span (1538, 1593)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit helps working people to maintain work life balance, with text span (560, 613)\nthe new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby, with text span (635, 704)\nPeople also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours, with text span (706, 771)\nFor students too, studying from home is an attractive option, with text span (773, 833)\nThey save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies, with text span (835, 919)\nIn a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling, with text span (921, 990)\nthe benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous, with text span (467, 549)\nonce an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues, with text span (1230, 1351)\nThis harms an employee's deliverable, with text span (1353, 1389)\nTeachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly, with text span (1391, 1497) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSpending equal amount of money on libraries and sports?\n\nUniversity students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.\nFirst, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football\/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.\nIn addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.\nFinally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. \nIn conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nboth sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories, with text span (2219, 2325)\nI don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities, with text span (374, 515)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nI do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, with text span (2123, 2205)\nspending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football\/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports, with text span (535, 684)\nThe university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students, with text span (1300, 1387)\nspending money on social activities looks like wasting money, with text span (1719, 1779)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmy roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory, with text span (699, 820)\nWhen she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day, with text span (822, 937)\nshe is doing exercise without spending a cent, with text span (951, 996)\nWhat the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health, with text span (998, 1231)\nstudents choose their major based on their interests, with text span (1246, 1298)\ntheir major in completely involved in physical activities, with text span (1397, 1454)\nfor an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, with text span (1469, 1579)\nit really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field, with text span (1589, 1708)\nFor students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose, with text span (1781, 1926)\nwhen I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people, with text span (1940, 2105) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nQualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs\n\nWith the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. \nFirstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. \nOn the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.\nTo my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nqualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs, with text span (1594, 1686)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others, with text span (1693, 1885)\nqualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer, with text span (504, 589)\nthe importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers, with text span (963, 1049)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIt is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job, with text span (591, 690)\npeople who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience, with text span (706, 826)\nSocial skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery, with text span (828, 921)\norganization have been transformed to customers oriented, with text span (1361, 1417)\nExcellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction, with text span (1419, 1559)\npeople nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently, with text span (1065, 1136)\nInterpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise, with text span (1138, 1265)\nBetter social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way, with text span (1267, 1350) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nConcentrate on the objectives - people attend schools for various reasons\n\nFrom many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.\nFirst of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.\nSecondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. \nLast but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.\nIn summation, people may attend university for various reasons.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCheap air travel should be encouraged?\n\nIn recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.\nIt is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.\nOn the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. \nIn conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLeisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors.\n\nPeople often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.\nThere are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. \nOutdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. \nMoreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.\nAdmittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhether athletes and singers are overpaid?\n\nSome people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.\nFirst of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. \nHowever, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCan technology alone solve the world's environmental problems?\n\nIt is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.\nSome people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.\nOn the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.\nThere are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.\nTo put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ntechnology alone can solve the world's environmental problems, with text span (1955, 2016)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nif humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment, with text span (459, 558)\ntechnology alone could save the environment, with text span (930, 973)\nThere are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot, with text span (1147, 1234)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is the luxuries people use which damages the environment, with text span (576, 635)\nIf people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment, with text span (637, 880)\nnow we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back, with text span (991, 1062)\nWe cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart, with text span (1064, 1145)\nOne prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa, with text span (1236, 1331)\nBy pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource, with text span (1333, 1509)\nJapan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030, with text span (1524, 1592)\nBy drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions, with text span (1594, 1743)\nIf successful, the impact on the world would be monumental, with text span (1745, 1803)\nIt would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes, with text span (1805, 1859)\nIt would mean another industrial revolution, with text span (1861, 1904) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople should have hobbies and do physical activities\n\nWhether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.\nFirst, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.\nAlso, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.\nLast, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.\nAlthough it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nHaving one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits, with text span (274, 359)\nit is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work, with text span (1804, 1898)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, with text span (1624, 1685)\nhaving hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit, with text span (368, 440)\nhaving hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind, with text span (947, 999)\nwe should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured, with text span (1274, 1397)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ndoing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness, with text span (1691, 1787)\ndoing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted, with text span (507, 589)\nLooking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, with text span (442, 502)\nMy neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company, with text span (591, 652)\nHe ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise, with text span (654, 710)\nWhen he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight, with text span (712, 807)\nHe started to jog every morning, with text span (809, 840)\nAfter a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend, with text span (842, 892)\ndoing something for a long time can be boring, with text span (900, 945)\nat school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class, with text span (1014, 1129)\nHumans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours, with text span (1131, 1197)\nDoing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries, with text span (1199, 1266)\nPlaying musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar, with text span (1399, 1468)\nWhen I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves, with text span (1470, 1560)\nIt makes me feel better and gives me the confidence, with text span (1562, 1613) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLife in  a city is much better than life in the countryside\n\nAs far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.\nFirstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.\nIn addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.\nMoreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.\nFurthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.\nHowever, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.\nTaking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMore convincing\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. \nApart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. \nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI agree that face-to-face communication is better, with text span (469, 518)\nI prefer to express my opinion in person, with text span (2390, 2430)\nthe best way of communication is by means of face-to-face, with text span (2539, 2596)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite, with text span (2439, 2513)\nwe can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way, with text span (1178, 1260)\nwe are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face, with text span (1740, 1817)\ncommunication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication, with text span (1899, 2048)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ncommunicating in person can be more convincing, with text span (584, 630)\nSometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle, with text span (632, 776)\nHe once complained a service of a restaurant, with text span (778, 822)\nWithout exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it, with text span (824, 957)\nAfterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication, with text span (959, 1038)\nIf he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important, with text span (1040, 1165)\nit is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication, with text span (1346, 1406)\nI had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric, with text span (1422, 1493)\nHe said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore, with text span (1495, 1610)\nI just shocked and did not know what happened, with text span (1612, 1657)\nI realized that his facebook account was stolen, with text span (1668, 1715)\nIt is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words, with text span (2135, 2228)\nTalking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us, with text span (2230, 2346) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment should spend money on ARTs, not only on public services\n\nAs people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.\nAdmittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.\nOn the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.\nFrom the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.\nWith those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\narts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well, with text span (380, 451)\npublic services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure, with text span (2004, 2085)\nthe authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous, with text span (2105, 2207)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npublic services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability, with text span (943, 1056)\narts should by no means been disregarded by the government, with text span (1087, 1145)\nfunding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development, with text span (1545, 1618)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe government should give priority to public services and facilities, with text span (465, 534)\nthe government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable, with text span (552, 722)\npublic services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate, with text span (740, 930)\narts can enrich people's cultural lives, with text span (1161, 1200)\nCurrently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition, with text span (1202, 1302)\nthey require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure, with text span (1318, 1429)\nWithout arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems, with text span (1431, 1504)\nCultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts, with text span (1620, 1675)\npreserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry, with text span (1688, 1893)\narts serve cultural and economic purposes, with text span (1909, 1950) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe best way of learning life\n\nLife is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.\nOn one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.\nOn the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.\nAccording to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA more convenient life in a city\n\nThere are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.\nOn the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.\nOn the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.\nFurthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome people prefer to work for a large company\n\nCompanies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.\nFirst, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.\nSecond, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.\nThird, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.\nIn conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI personally prefer to work for a large company, with text span (321, 368)\nI would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one, with text span (1596, 1664)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nI have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences, with text span (1666, 1862)\nto find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company, with text span (397, 486)\na large company can give better salaries than a smaller one, with text span (862, 921)\nlarge companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people, with text span (1283, 1487)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nLarge company equals more job opportunity, with text span (798, 839)\nLarge companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries, with text span (488, 639)\nif a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there, with text span (654, 780)\nThe fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success, with text span (923, 1013)\nthis means that the company can give more salaries to its employees, with text span (1031, 1098)\ncommon sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company, with text span (1114, 1238)\nAs well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops, with text span (1489, 1552) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nParents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life\n\nNowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.\nFirst of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.\nSecondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.\nIn conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life, with text span (468, 559)\nto encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life, with text span (1733, 1834)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money, with text span (721, 773)\nby taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done, with text span (1156, 1248)\nto help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can, with text span (1598, 1699)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own, with text span (798, 878)\nAt the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book, with text span (880, 943)\nI spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend, with text span (960, 1012)\nI finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now, with text span (1025, 1144)\nwhen children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents, with text span (595, 713)\nif a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him, with text span (1264, 1387)\nTo compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school, with text span (1389, 1473)\nUnder the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work, with text span (1475, 1581) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAre museums necessary?\n\nI believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.\nMost people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.\nIn order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you \"visit\" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.\nSeeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYounger school children should study art and music\n\nUndoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.\nFirst of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. \nIn addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.\nAdmittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.\nIn a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe art and music should be required to study, with text span (633, 678)\nyounger students' art and music education should not take the second place, with text span (2659, 2733)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life, with text span (349, 443)\nart and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful, with text span (694, 774)\nstudying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax, with text span (1311, 1400)\nthe school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure, with text span (2328, 2492)\nin the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, with text span (2509, 2657)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthose subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays, with text span (452, 587)\nIt is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures, with text span (776, 966)\nlearning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures, with text span (993, 1140)\nstudents are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played, with text span (1156, 1295)\nwith the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself, with text span (1413, 1624)\nArt and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life, with text span (1626, 1751)\nWhen enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for, with text span (1753, 1970)\nthey would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved, with text span (1988, 2080)\nthis sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art, with text span (2094, 2157)\nthe study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest, with text span (2171, 2251)\nThe education of art and music would not work if students resist it, with text span (2253, 2320) END"}

This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.\nHowever, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being.

For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.\nIn conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked, with text span (1881, 1977)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nnewly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, with text span (1765, 1857)\nthe production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased, with text span (756, 854)\nhigh-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being, with text span (865, 944)\nexcessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society, with text span (1299, 1396)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\napplying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit, with text span (437, 552)\nartificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest, with text span (570, 740)\nUnlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently, with text span (946, 1158)\nconsumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future, with text span (1174, 1287)\nOne is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission, with text span (1398, 1482)\nmanual harvest prevents severe environmental damages, with text span (1497, 1549)\nmechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, with text span (1564, 1646)\nhigh-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields, with text span (1665, 1736) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe precondition of doing research by professors\n\nNowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.\nTo begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors' duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.\nOn the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.\nNevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.\nConsequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy\n\nThe topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.\nFirst and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.\nAnother reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.\nLast but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.\nTo sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.

A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.\nHowever, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.\nIn conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncomputer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device, with text span (414, 503)\nin era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life, with text span (1378, 1457)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npeople cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it, with text span (1470, 1542)\nthis modern device has been a major hindrance to some people, with text span (525, 585)\nusing computer can make people easier to complete their work, with text span (958, 1018)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThis situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use, with text span (1544, 1645)\nthey spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working, with text span (754, 851)\nA study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, with text span (587, 731)\nthe idea that computers could be a help has been neglected, with text span (889, 947)\nThis is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer, with text span (1259, 1361)\nCommunication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country, with text span (1122, 1257)\nBusinessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues, with text span (1020, 1120) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nImproving facilities is the best way\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. \nMoreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.\nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. \nBased on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI prefer to spend money on improving facilities, with text span (526, 573)\nimproving facilities is the best way for school, with text span (2212, 2259)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other, with text span (2268, 2336)\nstudents can procure more advantages from better facilities, with text span (2354, 2413)\ncertain facilities are beneficial to students, with text span (1053, 1098)\nstudents would prefer school to spending on improving facilities, with text span (1596, 1660)\nschools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers, with text span (1737, 1794)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge, with text span (638, 722)\nlibrary is a good place for students to study or research, with text span (737, 794)\nThey can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize, with text span (796, 918)\nWith this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition, with text span (920, 1010)\nstudents are not always staying in classrooms, with text span (1150, 1195)\nThey have numerous activities in school, with text span (1197, 1236)\nConsider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school, with text span (1238, 1329)\nHe must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance, with text span (1331, 1408)\nWith this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind, with text span (1410, 1540)\nthey can impart their students well, with text span (1803, 1838)\nA student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study, with text span (1957, 2066)\nIt is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards, with text span (2068, 2154) END"}

Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.\nPressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudents should attend to classes or it should be optional?\n\nNowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.\nFirst and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. \nAnother significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. \nFinally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class's disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. \nOn the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nbeing present at classes seems a wiser option, with text span (530, 575)\ncommunicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials, with text span (1985, 2064)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nbeing present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college, with text span (618, 818)\nby the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier, with text span (1084, 1156)\nappearing in class makes students more conscientious, with text span (1492, 1544)\nteachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it, with text span (2076, 2216)\nattending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success, with text span (2224, 2356)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey can help each other for learning materials better, with text span (826, 880)\nif they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems, with text span (891, 1007)\nteachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points, with text span (1163, 1273)\nIn this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study, with text span (1275, 1464)\nthey have to obey class's disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments, with text span (1551, 1672)\nthe ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times, with text span (1683, 1821)\nthey may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study, with text span (1841, 1921) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversities require students to study many subjects or specialize in one subject\n\nUniversity is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.\nFirst of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.\nIn addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.\nFinally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLearning to be independent is essential for young adults\n\nLearning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.\nFirst of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.\nFurthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.\nThe third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.\nTo sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstaying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult, with text span (211, 308)\nstaying longer with parents is a better choice, with text span (1924, 1970)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nliving with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents, with text span (1818, 1915)\nundergoing with parents is worthwhile, with text span (879, 916)\nthe parents can save money, if their children live with them longer, with text span (1305, 1372)\ntaking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily, with text span (1730, 1805)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe young adult can have more experience with his parents, with text span (469, 526)\nThe young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age, with text span (528, 611)\nWhen having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown, with text span (613, 682)\nIf he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together, with text span (684, 805)\nAll memories become priceless treasure as time passes by, with text span (807, 863)\nhe may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents, with text span (1064, 1140)\nanother daily expense is also the considerable outgoings, with text span (1152, 1208)\nSpending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be, with text span (1210, 1292)\nliving at home costs less than living outside, with text span (931, 976)\nLearning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home, with text span (978, 1051)\nthe young adult needs father and mother's suggestions, with text span (1410, 1463)\nWhen in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand, with text span (1465, 1533)\nThey are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way, with text span (1535, 1642)\nIf the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain, with text span (1644, 1721) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversity education is needed for success\n\nIn today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.\nFirst and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.\nLooking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.\nIn addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.\nTo wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\none can also shine without even having to attend universities, with text span (397, 458)\nit would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions, with text span (2177, 2295)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper, with text span (2065, 2166)\nit is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer, with text span (480, 613)\nthere are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university, with text span (1016, 1129)\nindividuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful, with text span (1974, 2044)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWithout proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers, with text span (615, 724)\nNot only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners, with text span (726, 886)\nThis can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals, with text span (888, 980)\nTake for instance those who start their own business, with text span (1131, 1183)\nThese people depend solely on hard work and luck, with text span (1185, 1233)\nfor some of them it proved to be a profitable job, with text span (1250, 1299)\nMichael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19, with text span (1321, 1391)\nhe started his computer company in his college dorm room, with text span (1404, 1460)\nhe used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now, with text span (1474, 1564)\npeople with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life, with text span (1579, 1650)\nThis is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports, with text span (1652, 1716)\nThe introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph, with text span (1718, 1830)\nDavid Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many, with text span (1860, 1946) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSaving\/Spending money\n\nIn recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.\nFirst, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.\nIn addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. \nFinally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend.

I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons.

My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.\nMost importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.\nLast but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.\nTo sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nWorking fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal, with text span (227, 281)\npeople should work faster even more risky, with text span (1955, 1996)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nTrying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice, with text span (357, 517)\nGaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages, with text span (1998, 2135)\nif persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study, with text span (534, 594)\npeople prone to work in two or three firms in a week, with text span (1056, 1108)\npeople who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks, with text span (1445, 1499)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nAttending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter, with text span (596, 722)\nIf people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace, with text span (724, 827)\nI have a friend who was working so slowly, with text span (842, 883)\nHe has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him, with text span (885, 945)\nMy friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working, with text span (947, 1036)\nIf they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money, with text span (1151, 1218)\nThis fact pushes them to work faster and faster, with text span (1220, 1267)\napplying to study abroad needs a lot of money, with text span (1290, 1335)\nI am working in two organization to gain more salary, with text span (1337, 1389)\nthe expenses have been increased, with text span (1117, 1149)\nThe more money, the more chances, with text span (1391, 1423)\nIf you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks, with text span (1501, 1634)\nIf you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder, with text span (1636, 1729)\nIt turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation, with text span (1731, 1799)\nEven if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money, with text span (1801, 1893) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nReading fictions is more pleasant\n\nThere are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.\nFirstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.\nSecondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.\nSome people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.\nTo sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nreading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies, with text span (144, 198)\nreading fictions is more pleasant, with text span (1729, 1762)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthese books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners, with text span (1771, 1861)\nfiction books pay more attention to details, with text span (235, 278)\nreading a novel is more convenient, with text span (740, 774)\npeople enjoy watching TV, with text span (1303, 1327)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwe can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it, with text span (289, 369)\nMost of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening, with text span (371, 490)\nafter I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people, with text span (505, 646)\na movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters, with text span (657, 728)\nSome novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour, with text span (776, 857)\nYet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains, with text span (859, 963)\nI have started to read a novel since last week, with text span (978, 1024)\nI do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class, with text span (1026, 1141)\nI cannot watch a complete movie, with text span (1156, 1187)\nI can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study, with text span (1196, 1272)\nthey can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies, with text span (1343, 1416)\nmovies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners, with text span (1470, 1530)\ncharacters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners, with text span (1537, 1607)\nFor these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable, with text span (1609, 1716) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCelebrities & Their Influences\n\nSome people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.\nFirst of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. \nMoreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. \nIn conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction\n\nSome people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.\nIt is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. \nNevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. \nIn summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nother celebrities do lead young people in the right direction, with text span (1900, 1961)\nthis is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs, with text span (255, 341)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsome celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, with text span (1812, 1898)\nthe attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status, with text span (775, 864)\nother celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments, with text span (953, 1049)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nsome celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public, with text span (359, 428)\nsome movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention, with text span (443, 594)\nIf they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work, with text span (596, 759)\ncelebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans, with text span (1060, 1170)\npeople understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results, with text span (1188, 1284)\nthis kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance, with text span (1297, 1412)\nother celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career, with text span (1424, 1507)\nTake Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation, with text span (1509, 1649)\nHis songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society, with text span (1651, 1788) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGiving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect\n\nIn this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.\nFirst of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.\nSecondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.\nThird, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.\nIn conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy.

I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.\nFirst of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.\nSecond of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDistance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom\n\nDuring these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.\nFirst, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.\nSecond, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.\nLastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.\nIn conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students.

Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTv has NO negative effects on children\n\nNowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.\nFirst of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. \nIn addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudents should be required to take regular standardized tests\n\nThe issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.\nFirstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.\nAdditionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.\nFinally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don't because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.\nUltimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstandardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge, with text span (255, 403)\nschools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right, with text span (1822, 1896)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthese schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students, with text span (1934, 2033)\nstandardized tests are preferable, with text span (414, 447)\nschools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides, with text span (1197, 1299)\nrequirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, with text span (1323, 1381)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nexams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students, with text span (637, 721)\nsome students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue, with text span (530, 624)\nmany teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, with text span (736, 803)\nthe usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them, with text span (808, 871)\nsome students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, with text span (983, 1065)\nthey will never try to solve problems on their own, with text span (1070, 1120)\nstandardized tests offer them such chance, with text span (1131, 1172)\nstandardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice, with text span (887, 974)\nin this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students, with text span (1389, 1467)\nIn any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively, with text span (1469, 1594)\nstandardized tests are required over those who don't, with text span (1639, 1691)\nif the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them, with text span (1700, 1797)\nthey help teachers to fairly grade the students, with text span (469, 516) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology\n\nThe life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.\nThe first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.\nSecond, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.\nThe third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.\nIn conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSmoking should not be permitted in restaurants\n\nGenerally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.\nFirst of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. \nSecondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.\nLast but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.\nIn conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nsmoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants, with text span (421, 498)\nsmoking should not be permitted in restaurants, with text span (1870, 1916)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably, with text span (507, 557)\nSmoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals, with text span (655, 738)\nSmoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children, with text span (1001, 1062)\nSmoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs, with text span (1180, 1299)\nit is unfair for passive smokers, with text span (1745, 1777)\nthere will be a lot of people get disadvantaged, with text span (1925, 1972)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nrestaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals, with text span (573, 653)\nThey will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them, with text span (740, 819)\nrestaurants are places that people usually come with their families, with text span (832, 899)\nthere will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants, with text span (913, 999)\nChildren have a high potential to imitate what adults do, with text span (1064, 1120)\nthey have really high curiosity towards something, with text span (1129, 1178)\nThe most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women, with text span (1301, 1381)\nthey will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies, with text span (1390, 1476)\nthey do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one, with text span (1786, 1853)\npassive smokers will have a lot of health risks, with text span (1498, 1545)\nWhen they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke, with text span (1547, 1620)\nStroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers, with text span (1622, 1722) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould students be required to attend classes?\n\nThe issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.\nFirstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.\nSecondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.\nIn addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.\nFinally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.\nTo conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents should be free not to attend classes, with text span (463, 508)\nit is clear that going to classes should be optional for students, with text span (2411, 2476)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills, with text span (517, 627)\nI hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards, with text span (2478, 2640)\nsome students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook, with text span (867, 959)\nbeing free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life, with text span (1232, 1327)\nBy giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves, with text span (2154, 2312)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThis problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic, with text span (961, 1020)\nBy letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching, with text span (1022, 1121)\nthey are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently, with text span (1128, 1217)\nSometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning, with text span (1329, 1461)\nWith a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency, with text span (1463, 1606)\nResearch has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas, with text span (1608, 1734)\nIntrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being, with text span (1940, 2046)\nThese are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time, with text span (2314, 2396)\nin order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims, with text span (2057, 2152) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould universities accept equal number of males\/females or not\n\nEducation is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.\nRight to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.\nCo-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.\nUnfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.\nThus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSmoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places\n\nSmoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.\nFirst of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he\/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.\nFurthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. \nLastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGun control \n\nGun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.\nThe first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.\nSecondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.\nThirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.\nIn conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is sensible to enforce the gun control, with text span (282, 323)\nthe guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence, with text span (1577, 1702)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nconsidering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, with text span (1483, 1560)\nmost violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people, with text span (730, 848)\nthe fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates, with text span (599, 718)\nthe possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide, with text span (1203, 1261)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nguns will create a violent society if the trend continues, with text span (862, 919)\nin American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting, with text span (938, 1058)\nsome terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger, with text span (1075, 1192)\nThe accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns, with text span (389, 491)\nwe hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting, with text span (506, 594)\nIn the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent, with text span (1263, 1357)\nthere is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over, with text span (1374, 1466) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTelevision versus Friends and family\n\nWe all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.\nFirst of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.\nSecondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.\nLast but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?\nIn conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us, with text span (264, 352)\nit has destroyed communication among friends and family, with text span (1640, 1695)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntelevision has some good sides, with text span (1608, 1638)\nthey can be isolated from others, with text span (408, 440)\nchildren will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents, with text span (978, 1054)\ncommunication between family members is visibly destroyed, with text span (1168, 1225)\nwatching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human, with text span (1247, 1350)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\npeople watch television too much, with text span (374, 406)\nChildren, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others, with text span (442, 654)\nGradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying, with text span (656, 728)\nwith the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common, with text span (740, 847)\nParents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room, with text span (849, 958)\nparents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children, with text span (1066, 1153)\nwatching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing, with text span (1365, 1455) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSense of cooperation\n\nIn present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.\nA strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.\nOn the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.\nIn my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment budget focus, young children or university?\n\n\"Education is the investment in our future\", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.\nConcerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.\nThat's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.\nFrom reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both, with text span (468, 539)\na government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, with text span (1909, 1993)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nboth are crucial on the way to a brighter future, with text span (1995, 2043)\nif countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education, with text span (960, 1167)\ngovernment's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide, with text span (1687, 1840)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\na lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development, with text span (776, 942)\nelementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, with text span (557, 687)\ngovernment should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it, with text span (689, 771)\nResearches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, with text span (1605, 1672)\nfor higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance, with text span (1188, 1331)\nThe high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community, with text span (1333, 1487)\nSome may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, with text span (1489, 1573)\nthis argument is invalid, with text span (1579, 1603) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nComputers have made life easier\n\nThe advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. \nFirst, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. \nSecond, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. \nFinally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncomputers brought convenience and easiness to our life, with text span (332, 386)\ncomputers have made life easier and more convenient, with text span (1898, 1949)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication, with text span (393, 479)\ncomputers through internet made our access to information easier, with text span (489, 553)\ncommunication has become cheaper, faster and visual, with text span (1820, 1871)\nit broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways, with text span (1967, 2102)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwith the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources, with text span (1018, 1127)\nThrough computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed, with text span (555, 686)\nSearch engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes, with text span (688, 846)\nSocial networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments, with text span (848, 1009)\nin a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper, with text span (1138, 1229)\nWith the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes, with text span (1231, 1336)\nit is convenient, with text span (1351, 1367)\nyou do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world, with text span (1376, 1572)\nInternet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible, with text span (1574, 1647)\nvia skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities, with text span (1662, 1807) END"}

From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.\nTo begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.\nFurther, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.\nHowever, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLanguages' extinction, discuss both views\n\nIt is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.\nThere are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.\nDespite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildhood is the happiest time of a person's life\n\nI agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.\nStarting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. \nAnother great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.\nUsing your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.\nChildhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildhood is the happiest period of one's life, with text span (83, 129)\nChildhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives, with text span (1698, 1764)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nIt's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think, with text span (131, 350)\nduring our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to, with text span (615, 715)\nchildhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most, with text span (1227, 1294)\nUsing your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child, with text span (1296, 1394)\nIt's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults, with text span (1766, 1886)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nBeing late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult, with text span (717, 864)\nStarting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives, with text span (352, 449)\nWe are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave, with text span (451, 539)\nEvery action we make are watched closely and judged by the community, with text span (541, 609)\nThere are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see, with text span (1123, 1214)\nAnother great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day, with text span (867, 1002)\nBeing a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you, with text span (1004, 1121)\nChildren are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination, with text span (1396, 1558)\nIn adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, with text span (1560, 1627)\nthey are in no way free to think or use their imagination, with text span (1639, 1696) END"}

However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.\nIn the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.\nMoreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTelevision has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends\n\nThere are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.\nTo begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show \"Infinete Challenges\". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.\nMoreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ntelevision has more bad than good, with text span (365, 398)\nit is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward, with text span (1765, 1907)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit has made people not to have conversation each other, with text span (407, 461)\ntelevision shows make people forget what is really important, with text span (478, 538)\neven when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television, with text span (1186, 1301)\nIt is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close, with text span (1909, 2008)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time, with text span (628, 708)\nOne who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air, with text span (540, 620)\nthey think the programs are so crucial to their lives, with text span (715, 768)\nOne of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show \"Infinete Challenges\", with text span (770, 924)\nThis is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other, with text span (926, 1066)\nwatching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us, with text span (1077, 1174)\nit is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness, with text span (1402, 1494)\nWatching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone, with text span (1303, 1394)\nit is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together, with text span (1520, 1630)\nIt is natural they behave in that way, with text span (1632, 1669)\ntelevision shows don't require any participation, with text span (1678, 1726) END"}

Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.\nSome people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.\nOn the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.\nFrom my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhere to learn a new language?\n\nAlthough there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.\nPerson 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.\nOn the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.\nOn the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language.

Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.\nTaxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.\nSome people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax.

In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books.

I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.\nFirst of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. \nOne other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.\nMost important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues\n\nIn today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.\nThe second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.\nIn conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions, with text span (274, 387)\na greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being, with text span (1619, 1812)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsociety should be educated and became aware of health issues, with text span (736, 796)\na government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives, with text span (1233, 1388)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients, with text span (805, 944)\ndecreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients, with text span (541, 723)\nthere is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health, with text span (1112, 1220)\nthe marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign, with text span (1403, 1602) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment should be responsible for education and health care or not?\n\nDespite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.\nSome people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.\nOn the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nArtists' freedom to express ideas\n\nArtists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.\nFirst and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.\nFurthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.\nLooking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.\nTo conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece, with text span (301, 394)\nthere should not be any restrictions on artists' work, with text span (2217, 2270)\nthere should be no restrictions on them, with text span (2624, 2663)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthere are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas, with text span (2515, 2594)\nwithout any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists, with text span (844, 923)\nhuman rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely, with text span (1486, 1570)\nIn case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society, with text span (1865, 2019)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nAllowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves, with text span (2272, 2353)\nideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations, with text span (2357, 2411)\neven though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, with text span (2420, 2488)\nif there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run, with text span (416, 524)\nwhen they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies, with text span (548, 707)\npaintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times, with text span (722, 832)\nit is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation, with text span (938, 1070)\nToday, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries, with text span (1072, 1158)\nArts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country, with text span (1160, 1277)\nthe famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn, with text span (1307, 1478)\nartists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts, with text span (2049, 2179)\nThey might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country, with text span (1665, 1748)\nMalaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace, with text span (1770, 1863) END"}

Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.\nFirst and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMachines - positive or negative for humans\n\nAdvancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.\nIt is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.\nOn other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.\nAfter analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nusing machines is advantageous, with text span (1434, 1464)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmachines make work easy and smooth, with text span (1468, 1502)\nThe negative effects on health can be put on the back seat, with text span (1504, 1562)\nthe usage of machines is harmful for health of humans, with text span (459, 512)\nusing machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome, with text span (1298, 1370)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthere are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy, with text span (1571, 1625)\nmachines decrease the work done by people, with text span (519, 560)\nin many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days, with text span (575, 639)\nPeople opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs, with text span (641, 713)\nIt is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity, with text span (715, 817)\nthis example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects, with text span (822, 910)\nThe work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes, with text span (1116, 1267)\nusage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work, with text span (964, 1058)\nTake the example of use of food processors in kitchens, with text span (1060, 1114) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome important characteristics of a co-worker\n\nAt work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.\nThe co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.\nThe co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. \nFinally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship, with text span (446, 566)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe co-workers should believe in fellowship, with text span (2103, 2146)\nThe co-workers need to trust each other, with text span (1500, 1539)\nif the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment, with text span (1400, 1498)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThis helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships, with text span (2148, 2241)\nyou spend most of your day at office, with text span (2254, 2290)\nIf you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing, with text span (2292, 2356)\nThe co-workers should be cooperative with one another, with text span (568, 621)\nIf they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes, with text span (623, 679)\nThey should not act on suspicion, with text span (1541, 1573)\nhe always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not, with text span (744, 854)\nI once had a co-worker who was too family conscious, with text span (681, 732)\nMost of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person, with text span (856, 992)\none day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor, with text span (1003, 1081)\nWhen I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse, with text span (1083, 1208)\nFrom that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility, with text span (1210, 1377)\nThis is a very important aspect in the work environment, with text span (1575, 1630)\nI came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me, with text span (1632, 1750)\nTo a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him, with text span (1752, 1868)\nI never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me, with text span (1878, 1992)\nBut this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department, with text span (1994, 2091) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe gender issue for getting education needs\n\nThe gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.\nThe proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.\nAnother reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career.

So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInfluence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages\n\nIn the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.\nNo one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.\nAdmittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.\nIn conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit's a reasonable loss in globalization, with text span (226, 265)\nI'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around, with text span (1583, 1691)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nNo one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally, with text span (362, 451)\nthe culture heritage and nation identity vanish, with text span (1383, 1430)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ncommunication between countries and cultures become convenient, with text span (468, 530)\nIn my country, English is a required course from elementary school, with text span (532, 598)\nstudying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters, with text span (606, 662)\nlanguage obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country, with text span (674, 810)\nenhances relationship and promotes international business, with text span (827, 884)\nresearchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English, with text span (899, 1016)\nTaking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English, with text span (1018, 1098)\nIt's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides, with text span (1100, 1199)\nthey have no choice but choosing English as a second language, with text span (1214, 1275)\nEnglish is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year, with text span (1314, 1374)\nthis is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society, with text span (1441, 1531) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGiving mobile phones to the unemployed\n\nToday, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.\nIn a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.\nNonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.\nFurthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildren can effectively learn from watching television\n\nTV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.\nIt is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.\nBut on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. \nIn conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nby allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth, with text span (179, 281)\nif students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children, with text span (1520, 1670)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nIf children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study, with text span (283, 379)\nBy watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities, with text span (599, 673)\nwatching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health, with text span (942, 1020)\ndemerits of watching TV outweigh its merits, with text span (1467, 1510)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThere are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings, with text span (452, 597)\nCooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs, with text span (688, 921)\nTV is one of the prime source of data and information, with text span (397, 450)\nthey can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain, with text span (1035, 1116)\nSometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences, with text span (1118, 1242)\nMany times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades, with text span (1244, 1439) END"}

Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash.

Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPrepared Food\n\nNowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.\nFirst of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.\nNot cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.\nIn addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.\nIn conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould teachers be paid according to how much their students learn?\n\nEveryone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.\nTo begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.\nSecond, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.\nLastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.\nIn conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople will spend less time on cooking food\n\nPerhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.\nThe first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.\nAnother reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.\nSome people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.\nTo sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople are likely to spend less time in cooking food, with text span (271, 323)\npeople will spend less time in cooking food, with text span (2788, 2831)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future, with text span (1119, 1205)\nmost of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants, with text span (1230, 1286)\ninvesting much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family, with text span (1851, 1955)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\npeople nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years, with text span (717, 829)\nwith the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time, with text span (468, 702)\nin recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework, with text span (841, 1016)\nAnd this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology, with text span (1018, 1111)\nthey find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal, with text span (1646, 1700)\n89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on, with text span (1401, 1638)\nEven they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study, with text span (1702, 1822)\nit is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time, with text span (2478, 2576)\nas a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality, with text span (1994, 2102)\nhealth and life of eaters is assured, with text span (2245, 2281)\nEven, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, with text span (2104, 2238)\nalong with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities, with text span (2292, 2462)\nthey want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves, with text span (1295, 1369) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe ability to relate well to people is more important\n\nI think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:\nWe need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.\nOne of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. \nIn sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nboth the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job, with text span (215, 326)\nwe should notice to both of them, with text span (1771, 1803)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\neach of them has its own benefits, with text span (1812, 1845)\nstudying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job, with text span (856, 922)\nrelating well to people is also another important factor, with text span (1541, 1597)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIf we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future, with text span (562, 658)\nWe need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job, with text span (350, 421)\nIn school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them, with text span (451, 560)\nif someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job, with text span (673, 838)\nOne of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation, with text span (924, 1003)\nBy relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends, with text span (1005, 1071)\nwe will have a wide network of communication, with text span (1086, 1130)\nCommuincation can bring many benefits, with text span (1132, 1169)\nif you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well, with text span (1184, 1283)\nthey respect you as well, you can achieve your goal, with text span (1298, 1349)\nif you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers, with text span (1355, 1535)\nThis can be done in school, with text span (423, 449) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCreative Artists\n\nInnovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.\nOne of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.\nLet's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide - these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.\nBy way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas - this world needs them to make itself colourful.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nfreedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create, with text span (265, 406)\nthey should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas, with text span (2051, 2110)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthis world needs them to make itself colourful, with text span (2113, 2159)\nOne of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society, with text span (408, 546)\nrestrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply, with text span (1566, 1618)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work, with text span (567, 668)\nart inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning, with text span (697, 917)\nIf the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value, with text span (919, 1062)\nthe notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified, with text span (1286, 1348)\nsome of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc, with text span (1444, 1540)\nadolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents, with text span (1622, 1699)\nin the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide - these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art, with text span (1710, 1934) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system\n\nSome people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.\nFirstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.\nSecondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.\nMany parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them.

As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. \nOld buildings are an essential part of history.

Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould the cost of medicines be reduced?\n\nAt present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.\nAdmittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.\nHowever, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.\nFortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.\nIn conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums\n\nHow to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.\nTaking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.\nEntertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.\nFurthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.\nTo summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernment should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities, with text span (213, 321)\nbudgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, with text span (1916, 2026)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens, with text span (2036, 2147)\nproviding education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government, with text span (758, 846)\nEntertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented, with text span (848, 944)\nsectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, with text span (1723, 1799)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTaking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums, with text span (398, 543)\nan uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games, with text span (566, 745)\nTheir existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience, with text span (946, 1058)\nThe competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government, with text span (1060, 1193)\nthe establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government, with text span (1204, 1393)\nit is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs, with text span (1593, 1698)\nthey are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis, with text span (1809, 1878)\nputting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them, with text span (1408, 1511)\nnot everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot, with text span (1526, 1580) END"}

Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.\nA student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself.

Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.\nAnother reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.\nIn addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time.

Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.\nIn spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.\nSecond, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.\nLast but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.\nTo sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSuccess and knowledge\n\nMany people think that \"Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors\". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. \nFirst of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.\nSecondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement \"Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration\" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. \nLast but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCheap air travel should be encouraged?\n\nIn recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.\nIt is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.\nOn the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. \nIn conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits.

Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.\nFirst, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.\nSecond, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.\nThird, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nProblems and benefits of international tourism\n\nAlong with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.\nI admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.\nHowever, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.\nFurthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.\nIn conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPopularity of mobile phones to young people\n\nNowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.\nFirst of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.\nSecondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. \nThis clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person's education and character.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternational tourism is now more common than ever before\n\nThe last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.\nFirstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.\nSecondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia's Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat's anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthis industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations, with text span (262, 376)\nthe tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments, with text span (1663, 1758)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, with text span (179, 239)\ninternational tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries, with text span (953, 1031)\ntourism has threatened the nature environments, with text span (1578, 1624)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ntourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations, with text span (417, 530)\nTake Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits, with text span (532, 818)\nThis was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism, with text span (820, 924)\ntourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals, with text span (1074, 1158)\nAs the Australia's Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat's anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions, with text span (1160, 1413)\nmany marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species, with text span (1432, 1550) END"}

Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.\nFirst, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.\nMoreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.\nFinally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOpinions regarding world culture\n\nThere are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.\nFirstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.\nSecondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.\nSome people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.\nTo sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLearning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives\n\nThere are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.\nFirst, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. \nSecond, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. \nMoreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. \nAll in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nlearning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives, with text span (336, 408)\nlearning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life, with text span (1636, 1717)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better, with text span (748, 835)\nit would improve students' social behavior, with text span (846, 888)\nwhen a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently, with text span (1352, 1451)\nStudents would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc, with text span (1758, 1903)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations, with text span (476, 599)\nmore information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts, with text span (621, 733)\nif they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life, with text span (1099, 1234)\nIf students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well, with text span (890, 992)\nThey should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well, with text span (994, 1091)\nIt can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position, with text span (1535, 1597)\nconcerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life, with text span (1470, 1533)\nthese way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts, with text span (1247, 1329) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFactor of choosing a career.\n\nIn many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.\nTo begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.\nFurther and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthere are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard, with text span (189, 268)\nI disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, with text span (1318, 1385)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe salary is very pivotal factor, with text span (141, 174)\nthere are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements, with text span (1390, 1512)\nin order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well, with text span (298, 380)\ncareer promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary, with text span (948, 1116)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nPeople, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary, with text span (543, 690)\naspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life, with text span (391, 541)\nmost of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach, with text span (808, 930)\npeople, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries, with text span (1131, 1301) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nKeep trying and never stop working for your goals\n\n\"Keep running!,\" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. \nFirstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. \nSecondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. \nThirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. \nFor these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na person should keep trying for his goals, with text span (483, 524)\none should not give up, with text span (1631, 1653)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nAnyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life, with text span (1698, 1962)\ncommitting to our goal helps creating personal worth, with text span (536, 588)\none who learns the great difficulty will become stronger, with text span (823, 879)\nthe responsibility is worthy of carrying, with text span (1366, 1406)\nthe true reward is to have the dignity, with text span (1658, 1696)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nI realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard, with text span (603, 686)\nEven if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running, with text span (688, 810)\nI remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line, with text span (881, 975)\nI did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round, with text span (986, 1058)\nI knew how to improve myself, with text span (1067, 1095)\nI had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger, with text span (1097, 1225)\nWhen the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself, with text span (1408, 1517)\nHe can feel the sweetness of triumph, with text span (1519, 1555)\nhe did not stop pursing his goal, with text span (1564, 1596)\nwe, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on, with text span (1252, 1349) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSchools should only teach children the academic subject\n\nPeople have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.\nMany people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. \nAlthough those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.\nIn conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program, with text span (209, 317)\nthe effects of learning music, sports are profound, with text span (1616, 1666)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nstudents only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics, with text span (344, 415)\nthese subjects might fulfil the students' ability, with text span (1313, 1362)\nthe academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, with text span (1532, 1595)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthese subject are necessary for students' future, with text span (424, 472)\nwhen labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification, with text span (497, 599)\nthe unemployment rate is always high, with text span (614, 650)\nparents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job, with text span (661, 741)\nthere are many things much more important than having a job, with text span (808, 867)\nstudying music, art or sports is also very important to students, with text span (878, 942)\nThis enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them, with text span (944, 1043)\nto get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation, with text span (1055, 1177)\nthrough taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills, with text span (1193, 1300)\nchildren's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity, with text span (1373, 1506) END"}

The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.\nSecondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.\nLastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.\nTo conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudy at school or get a job?\n\nMany people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.\nFirst of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.\nNevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe opportunity to receive education from university\n\nThere are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. \nWhat is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.\nIn a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life.

Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYoung people should go to university or not\n\nPersistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.\nTo begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.\nHowever, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.\nTo sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges, with text span (2029, 2252)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nhigher education does not guarantee young students' success, with text span (1968, 2027)\nit is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming, with text span (977, 1118)\nuniversities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine, with text span (1201, 1342)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthere are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, with text span (618, 771)\nlabors for graduates are in short supply, with text span (791, 831)\nthe labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying, with text span (848, 960)\nThese academic values are necessary to the progress of the world, with text span (1344, 1408)\nmany researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society, with text span (1428, 1552)\ndiverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently, with text span (1605, 1690)\nthere are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships, with text span (1699, 1812) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould governments spend more money on improving roads and highways\n\nNowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.\nFirst and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. \nIn addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.\nIn conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment, with text span (328, 397)\npublic transportation systems even have more important advantages, with text span (1968, 2033)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air, with text span (484, 578)\nthe policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth, with text span (1244, 1353)\nThis is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment, with text span (947, 1075)\ngovernments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes, with text span (1641, 1732)\nhigh-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around, with text span (1891, 1952)\nThey not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere, with text span (2035, 2097)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nSuch public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society, with text span (399, 473)\nif there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released, with text span (1086, 1231)\ncarbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere, with text span (637, 713)\nthe more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged, with text span (732, 820)\nIf governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work, with text span (822, 945)\nthere are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads, with text span (1554, 1607)\nIt is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities, with text span (1432, 1513)\nThere is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion, with text span (1734, 1853)\nthe policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam, with text span (1369, 1430) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould we require our young children to learn music and art\n\nEvery parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. \nFirst, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.\nSecond, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.\nHowever, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. \nIn conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his\/her life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildren should learn music and art in a young age, with text span (371, 421)\nyoung age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art, with text span (2048, 2113)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey do contribute several merits to them, with text span (430, 471)\nMusic and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his\/her life, with text span (2204, 2299)\nit's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young, with text span (481, 567)\neven if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy, with text span (1322, 1425)\nparents shouldn't put so much stress on children, with text span (1523, 1571)\nthey are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage, with text span (2118, 2202)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances, with text span (875, 977)\nChildren are privileged to have these abilities, with text span (819, 866)\nChildren absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination, with text span (569, 667)\nMusic and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules, with text span (669, 740)\nThey are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched, with text span (742, 817)\nEven if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination, with text span (979, 1119)\nmusic and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing, with text span (1129, 1188)\nThey teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way, with text span (1190, 1267)\nThey are essential to our spiritual life, with text span (1269, 1309)\nit can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure, with text span (1434, 1483)\nlearning too many skills seems to be a burden for them, with text span (1579, 1633)\nit depends on how you value these learning activities to be like, with text span (1650, 1714)\nIf parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much, with text span (1716, 1842)\nIn a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills, with text span (1844, 1975)\nit will not be such pressure on children, with text span (1990, 2030) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo arts and music improve the quality of life?\n\nMy view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.\nArt is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMost difficult experiences will become valuable lessons\n\nThere is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.\nTo start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.\nWhat's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles.

Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.\nSo, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nRoommates quality and their importance\n\nMuch has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. \nConsideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.\nMoreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.\nIn conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important.

According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.\nFurthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversity education should be only available for good students\n\nThe purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.\nFirst, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.\nSecondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.\nTo sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners, with text span (309, 419)\neveryone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students, with text span (1944, 2082)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThis will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most, with text span (2084, 2202)\nfocusing only on talented students is a better option, with text span (428, 481)\nuniversity should only accept good students, with text span (1057, 1100)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality, with text span (490, 558)\nUnlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge, with text span (560, 715)\nsome students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones, with text span (726, 840)\nThat explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, with text span (842, 960)\nthey need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone, with text span (968, 1045)\nit gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes, with text span (1109, 1167)\nthis may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', with text span (1192, 1296)\nit gives no harm to the whole community, with text span (1311, 1350)\nThose standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions, with text span (1352, 1522)\nlimiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice, with text span (1532, 1614)\nit will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves, with text span (1621, 1774)\nthis improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society, with text span (1788, 1912) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCreativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions\n\nCreativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.\nTime and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.\nNonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.\nUnfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, \"Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open\". Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.\nHowever, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncreative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions, with text span (225, 315)\nartists should be given the freedom of expression, with text span (1786, 1835)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nCreativity originates in a free mind, with text span (180, 216)\nCreative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message, with text span (619, 692)\ninnovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience, with text span (707, 804)\nLike the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely, with text span (1364, 1450)\nMind can not work when it is chained in boundaries, with text span (1837, 1887)\nImagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws, with text span (1889, 2001)\nArtists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose, with text span (1650, 1762)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTime and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message, with text span (317, 464)\nRight from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras, with text span (466, 617)\nIt helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments, with text span (806, 880)\nBangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue, with text span (896, 1014)\nThis type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds, with text span (1016, 1077)\ncreativity also gives aesthetic charm, with text span (1092, 1129)\nFrank Zappa once said, \"Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open\", with text span (1185, 1267)\nRestrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains, with text span (1269, 1362)\nartists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people, with text span (1461, 1526)\nMany artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people, with text span (1528, 1648) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCapital punishment; 51% countries have polished death penalty\n\n\"Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime.\" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.\nFirstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.\nSecondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.\nFinally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. \nTo conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty, with text span (607, 684)\nThe world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty, with text span (2453, 2530)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ndeath penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture, with text span (1063, 1146)\nnobody has the right to take another human life, with text span (1158, 1205)\nwith some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out, with text span (1607, 1676)\nit neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society, with text span (2366, 2451)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nCrimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one, with text span (790, 933)\nthe criminal is repeated second time, with text span (950, 986)\ncapital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture, with text span (719, 788)\nthe rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being, with text span (1229, 1295)\nNo one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder, with text span (1297, 1374)\nIf you kill a criminal, you become a criminal, with text span (1376, 1421)\ncrimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment, with text span (1543, 1596)\nif we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral, with text span (1433, 1531)\nIf they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them, with text span (1727, 1828)\nThey do not undergo any pain or misery, with text span (1830, 1868)\nCriminals should be punished for their misdeeds, with text span (1678, 1725)\ncapital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life, with text span (2228, 2358)\nrehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts, with text span (2116, 2212)\nWhy do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better, with text span (2022, 2104)\nsome industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors, with text span (1929, 2020)\nit is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family, with text span (994, 1054) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas?\n\nWhen we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don't think it's proper.\nFirst, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don't want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can't always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.\nEven in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.\nIn fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won't last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.\nBased on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nif the good people always get an happy ending, I don't think it's proper, with text span (315, 387)\nmovies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing, with text span (1996, 2098)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nwe can't always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs, with text span (924, 992)\nif children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world, with text span (1138, 1258)\nwe should show people the truth in the stories, with text span (1839, 1885)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nif all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring, with text span (396, 454)\nIf good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas, with text span (456, 530)\nThen we will feel less interested in them, with text span (532, 573)\nBut if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story, with text span (575, 697)\nHollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl, with text span (712, 798)\nBut now many people, including me, have been tired with it, with text span (800, 858)\nI don't want to see the same kind of ending again and again, with text span (860, 919)\nThey will be misleading by those movies, with text span (1260, 1299)\nthey may act like good people in order to get reward, with text span (1305, 1357)\nOnce they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person, with text span (1359, 1466)\nthe good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not, with text span (1481, 1547)\nwe should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding, with text span (1552, 1623)\nEven in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes, with text span (994, 1060)\nit happen more often in the real world than in those movies, with text span (1074, 1133)\nthose good endings sometimes are helpful, with text span (1634, 1674)\nSome people may be encouraged to do good things, with text span (1676, 1723)\nthis kind of behavior won't last long, with text span (1742, 1779)\nsomeday they will realize the truth, with text span (1789, 1824)\nif they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends, with text span (1891, 1957) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPrevention is better than cure\n\nIt is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.\nHealth education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.\nPreventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGrowing traffic and pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices\n\nAs we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.\nSpecifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.\nAs illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.\nIn conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, with text span (371, 441)\naddressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, with text span (1959, 2043)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly, with text span (900, 952)\nseveral other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems, with text span (1277, 1371)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated, with text span (670, 762)\nprice control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area, with text span (528, 659)\ngovernments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands, with text span (777, 884)\npollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution, with text span (973, 1110)\nthe improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours, with text span (1125, 1252)\nauthorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars, with text span (1384, 1550)\ntemporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season, with text span (1565, 1695)\nwith supervisory institutions built to find and address problems, with text span (1702, 1766)\ncultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice, with text span (1779, 1942) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLiving with a roommate is better than Living alone\n\nMany single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.\nLiving with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.\nApart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.\nFinally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.\nIn conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI prefer to live with a roommate, with text span (319, 351)\nI prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will, with text span (2190, 2241)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help, with text span (369, 438)\nmany people decide to live alone for various reasons, with text span (2136, 2188)\nit offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help, with text span (2259, 2343)\nLiving with a roommate saves me a lot of money, with text span (440, 486)\nliving with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily, with text span (965, 1028)\nliving with a roommate allows me to get help, with text span (1569, 1613)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIf you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them, with text span (488, 558)\nyou can get more for less, with text span (571, 596)\nlast year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly, with text span (611, 819)\nI was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills, with text span (821, 929)\nIt is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you, with text span (1030, 1103)\nYou can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together, with text span (1105, 1183)\none night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along, with text span (1199, 1256)\nEven though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other, with text span (1258, 1357)\nWe soon found out that everyone loved playing video games, with text span (1359, 1416)\nWe played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends, with text span (1418, 1498)\nLiving with a roommate made socializing much easier for me, with text span (1500, 1558)\nIt often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need, with text span (1615, 1693)\nWhen you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help, with text span (1695, 1767)\nSome of them may have something to offer, with text span (1769, 1809)\nwhen my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help, with text span (1826, 1915)\nThey failed to give me any useful solutions, with text span (1917, 1960)\nTo my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help, with text span (1962, 2037)\nHe was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly, with text span (2039, 2113) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPaying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.\nA raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.\nNevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.\nTo sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees, with text span (1562, 1648)\nproviding a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity, with text span (1665, 1769)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses, with text span (1776, 1856)\nA raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places, with text span (346, 423)\ncreating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances, with text span (1055, 1203)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWorkers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile, with text span (425, 533)\njunior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work, with text span (549, 704)\nit is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want, with text span (726, 812)\nIf the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan, with text span (814, 1024)\nTake Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce, with text span (1205, 1361)\nthe employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured, with text span (1378, 1534) END"}

Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. \nFirst, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues\n\nIn today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.\nThe second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.\nIn conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions, with text span (274, 387)\na greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being, with text span (1619, 1812)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsociety should be educated and became aware of health issues, with text span (736, 796)\ngovernments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society, with text span (968, 1095)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ndecreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients, with text span (541, 723)\nthe potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients, with text span (805, 944)\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system, with text span (389, 524)\nthere is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health, with text span (1112, 1220)\na government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives, with text span (1233, 1388)\nthe marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign, with text span (1403, 1602) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDrugs, alcohol and messy sex lives\n\nCelebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.\nThe first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard.

Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.\nThe use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.\nThe use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTeacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects\n\nRecently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. \nIn the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.\nFurthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. \nLast but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.\nIn conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects, with text span (359, 430)\nteachers are the best for children's education, with text span (1680, 1726)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nNot only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world, with text span (1728, 1921)\nschool teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education, with text span (453, 526)\nteaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills, with text span (828, 929)\nit was impossible for them to be a good teacher, with text span (1616, 1663)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nto be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge, with text span (542, 673)\nin comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics, with text span (684, 813)\nafter many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills, with text span (944, 1174)\nparents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way, with text span (1189, 1340)\ncompared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children, with text span (1363, 1447)\nNowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, with text span (1449, 1541)\nthere is only limited time for them to teach their children, with text span (1549, 1608) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversity students should attend classes or not?\n\nIn university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. \nFirst, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. \nSecond, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.\nSome people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. \nIn conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is, with text span (518, 595)\nstudents can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes, with text span (2014, 2131)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nin terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams, with text span (605, 705)\nIt's an essential learning process, with text span (2133, 2167)\nclass attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances, with text span (1221, 1291)\nif students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own, with text span (1416, 1539)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nClasses are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students, with text span (707, 819)\nProfessors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements, with text span (821, 964)\nThose who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes, with text span (1293, 1385)\nMany professors grade their students with class attendances, with text span (1144, 1203)\nAttending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves, with text span (1028, 1142)\nit's students' basic responsibility to attend class, with text span (975, 1026)\nthis is a rather immodest way of thinking, with text span (1635, 1676)\nprofessors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors, with text span (1693, 1830)\neven if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates, with text span (1841, 1996) END"}

From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.\nAdmittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. \nThe company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. \nEmployees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.\nTo sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nRush vs Slower Pace\n\nModern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.\nFirst, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.\nIn addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.\nFinally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.\nIn conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is very important to live life at a slower pace, with text span (420, 470)\nliving a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work, with text span (2037, 2139)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nliving in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages, with text span (480, 536)\nliving your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health, with text span (545, 623)\nliving your life at a slower pace increases your happiness, with text span (1062, 1120)\nyou might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience, with text span (1785, 1852)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIf you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle, with text span (625, 739)\nMany hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, with text span (741, 806)\ntheir bodies cannot hold the pace, with text span (816, 849)\nmy father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job, with text span (865, 935)\nAfter several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine, with text span (937, 1047)\nIf you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's, with text span (1122, 1198)\nIf you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends, with text span (1200, 1279)\nCaring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level, with text span (1281, 1378)\na friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, with text span (1393, 1463)\nhe can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships, with text span (1473, 1526)\nWhen you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes, with text span (1557, 1678)\nDoing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities, with text span (1680, 1771)\nquality takes time, with text span (1537, 1555)\nI once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, with text span (1869, 1921)\nI made few mistakes I could have avoided, with text span (1931, 1971) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe environment problems facing today's world are so great\n\nNowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.\nOn one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.\nBesides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.\nOn the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.\nIn conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nboth government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, with text span (314, 398)\nthe government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment, with text span (1906, 2063)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsolving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems, with text span (462, 624)\nwe should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, with text span (1182, 1261)\nit is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment, with text span (1456, 1610)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nair pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances, with text span (639, 902)\nindividuals are unable to cope with these things, with text span (913, 961)\nIt is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection, with text span (1069, 1164)\nthe government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people, with text span (972, 1067)\nthe government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens, with text span (1267, 1435)\nmany people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment, with text span (1626, 1745)\nIf people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement, with text span (1747, 1889) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSerious or entertaining movies\n\nI prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. \nFirst, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.\nSecond, not all of serious movies are boring. \"Click\" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.\nMoreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. \"Blood diamond\", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIs it necessary to teach children handwriting?\n\nIn this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.\nDespite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.\nSecondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. \nTo conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildren are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting, with text span (264, 330)\nhandwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age, with text span (1658, 1749)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nhandwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning, with text span (404, 462)\npoor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance, with text span (1007, 1082)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthis approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing, with text span (473, 574)\nIt enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well, with text span (576, 679)\nUnder the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting, with text span (681, 772)\nThis way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities, with text span (774, 909)\nkids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons, with text span (1101, 1190)\nIt resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works, with text span (1192, 1276)\nthe increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills, with text span (1288, 1415)\nwith the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes, with text span (1430, 1569) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildren managing their own money - best way to learn responsibility\n\nOne of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.\nThe first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.\nAnother aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.\nAlthough some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildren should learn to manage their own money at a young age, with text span (374, 436)\nit is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, with text span (2220, 2335)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues, with text span (647, 730)\nEven in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity, with text span (1352, 1545)\nchildren should be free to spend money to they what they want, with text span (2143, 2204)\nour personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood, with text span (2345, 2423)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nsociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne, with text span (528, 642)\nwhen I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked, with text span (800, 877)\nFirst time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished, with text span (879, 952)\nI asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me, with text span (954, 1019)\nI found that I should manage the way that I spend money, with text span (1021, 1076)\nI learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted, with text span (1088, 1150)\nI had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood, with text span (1567, 1680)\nHe became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money, with text span (1682, 1769)\nHis parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless, with text span (1771, 1901)\nFinally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died, with text span (1903, 2011)\nNot only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family, with text span (2013, 2109)\nIf parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs, with text span (1243, 1350) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nBenefits of students doing extra jobs\n\nIn present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.\nIt is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.\nSecondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.\nLastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.\nIn conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nhaving a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits, with text span (1977, 2064)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nBy taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation, with text span (2066, 2210)\nhaving experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation, with text span (856, 993)\nstudents who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones, with text span (1005, 1098)\ndoing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation, with text span (1505, 1570)\nthat helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life, with text span (1811, 1940)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIt is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs, with text span (394, 500)\nstudents who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience, with text span (751, 844)\nthat seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities, with text span (622, 736)\nPart-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities, with text span (502, 607)\nBy constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained, with text span (1100, 1290)\nworking conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities, with text span (1298, 1495)\nhigh studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students, with text span (1580, 1683)\nWith the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved, with text span (1685, 1799) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould wealthy nations support poor ones?\n\nWhether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.\nIn terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.\nEconomically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.\nIn summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nas the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor, with text span (247, 345)\nwealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways, with text span (1486, 1612)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nOnly those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run, with text span (1614, 1688)\nit is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so, with text span (367, 528)\nsuch aid could also create a win-win situation, with text span (691, 737)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nCompassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals, with text span (530, 666)\nUnderdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds, with text span (739, 813)\nFor developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations, with text span (815, 918)\nrelated research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry, with text span (925, 1047)\nThe potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning, with text span (1049, 1164)\nBy building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce, with text span (1166, 1316)\nThe underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy, with text span (1318, 1472) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCommunicating via e-mail and voice mail vs Telephone and face-to face\n\nAlthough many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.\nFirstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.\nSecondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.\nThirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTelevision destroys communication among friends and family\n\nTelevision is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.\nFirst, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.\nSecond, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. \nThird, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. \nTo sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMore people are migrating to other countries than ever before\n\nThe last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries' cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.\nFirstly, maintaining one's cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one's pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.\nSecondly, it is crucial to keep one's identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.\nTo conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one's cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthey are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values, with text span (391, 489)\nsustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society, with text span (1936, 2077)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential, with text span (1089, 1156)\nkeeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important, with text span (1711, 1795)\nthere are opposing ideas of neglecting one's cultural values to adapt in the new cultures, with text span (1819, 1908)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmaintaining one's cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments, with text span (500, 624)\nTake Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues, with text span (626, 839)\nMany Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values, with text span (841, 946)\nThese feedbacks, in turn, help raise one's pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more, with text span (948, 1057)\nit is crucial to keep one's identity, with text span (1168, 1204)\nthey need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin, with text span (1209, 1307)\nchildren immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends, with text span (1323, 1412)\nIn this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home, with text span (1414, 1571)\nFail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism, with text span (1573, 1685) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGender Equality at university admission\n\nNowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.\nUniversities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. \nHowever, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nuniversities must open choice for everyone to select his subject, with text span (1498, 1562)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nwe must give them opportunity to achieve their goal, with text span (1774, 1825)\nUniversities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders, with text span (407, 475)\nuniversities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender, with text span (1357, 1459)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nOur youth has become very confident towards his career, with text span (1564, 1618)\nThey are not ready to be bound in certain limitations, with text span (1620, 1673)\nFemale candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer, with text span (1675, 1769)\nwomen have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor, with text span (514, 589)\nnowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky, with text span (604, 660)\nThey are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also, with text span (662, 729)\nuniversity authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination, with text span (744, 822)\nThey must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission, with text span (824, 907)\nthe current job market affects the decision of universities, with text span (919, 978)\nEvery university designs its courses according to the need of employers, with text span (980, 1051)\nThe job selection criteria are pre decided, with text span (1053, 1095)\nemployers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine, with text span (1110, 1211)\nThey prefer male staff for night shifts, with text span (1213, 1252)\nThey want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc, with text span (1254, 1344) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLiving in smal towns\n\nPlace of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.\nFirstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.\nSecondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.\nIn conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOnce you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success\n\nAchieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.\nFirst, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.\nSecond, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.\nIn conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nonce you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success, with text span (391, 456)\nbeing different and unique is the better way to achieve success, with text span (1786, 1849)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nIf you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you, with text span (701, 872)\nbeing unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others, with text span (1079, 1152)\nIt not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success, with text span (1851, 1970)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report, with text span (899, 977)\nI was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently, with text span (986, 1069)\nbeing positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others, with text span (465, 584)\nAs living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game, with text span (586, 653)\nOnly who has the sharpest weapon can survive, with text span (655, 699)\nTake the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example, with text span (1345, 1421)\nThe reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors, with text span (1423, 1569)\nIt has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers, with text span (1571, 1704)\nIt is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value, with text span (1706, 1769)\nonce you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you, with text span (1170, 1343) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPaying taxes is enough contribution from citizens\n\nPaying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.\nTo start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.\nHowever, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.\nIn conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthey have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way, with text span (1843, 1944)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nall people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, with text span (271, 335)\ncitizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax, with text span (878, 956)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens, with text span (340, 439)\na large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, with text span (454, 548)\nevery one can work and live in a peaceful environment, with text span (558, 611)\nThe tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers, with text span (613, 736)\nthese workers do not produce profit directly, with text span (747, 791)\nwhat they do is for the well-being of the whole society, with text span (793, 848)\nthere are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others, with text span (970, 1066)\nthe government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, with text span (1084, 1147)\nsuch financial help is usually far from enough, with text span (1153, 1199)\naids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support, with text span (1215, 1336)\nAnother responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force, with text span (1338, 1448)\nThere are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited, with text span (1450, 1550)\nit is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department, with text span (1555, 1736) END"}

Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.\nSecond, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.\nTelephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDistance-learning vs. attending school in person\n\nA matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.\nTo begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.\nNevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.\nBy way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases.

In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:\nFor one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.\nIn addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.\nNot to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.\nAs can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nevery fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one, with text span (47, 103)\na hurried decision is almost never a good one, with text span (1237, 1282)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmaking quick decisions leads to probable bad results, with text span (323, 375)\nmaking a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity, with text span (564, 662)\nhasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person, with text span (896, 989)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmaking a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects, with text span (193, 307)\nif someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision, with text span (390, 549)\nif this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position, with text span (681, 832)\nhe wouldn't have been unemployed, with text span (841, 873)\nTo put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, with text span (991, 1155)\nhis life had taken a turn to the worst, with text span (1163, 1201) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAir pollution\n\nAir pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. \nFirst, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.\nSecond, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. \nOn the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. \nIn conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nmore responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution, with text span (192, 302)\nboth companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution, with text span (1848, 1942)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ngovernments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, with text span (1698, 1846)\nIf these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause, with text span (703, 856)\nby charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution, with text span (1222, 1348)\ngovernments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies, with text span (1385, 1492)\nGovernments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals, with text span (1494, 1659)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nin most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions, with text span (312, 426)\nThe waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution, with text span (428, 536)\nWhile these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution, with text span (538, 701)\nprivate individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating, with text span (866, 971)\nAs house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes, with text span (973, 1130)\nsome expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution, with text span (1149, 1205) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity\n\nThe city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. \nHistoric buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. \nFurthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. \nMeanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. \nOverall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwe should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them, with text span (509, 643)\ngovernment should spend money on preservation of old buildings, with text span (2709, 2771)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nHistoric buildings have intrinsic values, with text span (709, 749)\nhistoric buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds, with text span (1428, 1530)\nhistoric buildings can be a source of maintenance fees, with text span (1991, 2045)\nthe city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity, with text span (2379, 2452)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey are significant symbols of a city, with text span (759, 797)\nOld buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity, with text span (799, 861)\nBy seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area, with text span (863, 1029)\nwhen somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, with text span (1044, 1166)\nit is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China, with text span (1176, 1291)\nDepending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture, with text span (1293, 1412)\nThe city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves, with text span (1532, 1677)\nthe warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace, with text span (1688, 1820)\nLying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful, with text span (1822, 1977)\nThere are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists, with text span (2047, 2222)\nOur governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle, with text span (2224, 2352)\nThere is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone, with text span (2518, 2586)\nthe preservation of old buildings is a one-way street, with text span (2463, 2516)\nThis reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance, with text span (2588, 2696) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPhysical exercise should be required part of every school day\n\nAlthough some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.\nPhysical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.\nDaily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.\nHaving children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. \nIncluding physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYoung adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out\n\nAs young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.\nLiving on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.\nAnother advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.\nWhile some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. \nIn a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nyoung adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time, with text span (339, 410)\nto cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time, with text span (1918, 2173)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nliving with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income, with text span (649, 778)\nAnother advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them, with text span (780, 895)\nyoung adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want, with text span (1338, 1408)\nyoung adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own, with text span (1673, 1783)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nLiving on your own is a huge financial commitment, with text span (412, 461)\nAt younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, with text span (463, 525)\nIt can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself, with text span (530, 628)\nParents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life, with text span (897, 994)\nLiving together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents, with text span (996, 1130)\nYoung adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents, with text span (1132, 1301)\nmost young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have, with text span (1434, 1522)\nIt is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs, with text span (1524, 1640)\nIt is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs, with text span (1785, 1910) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGun control and increasing violence\n\nSome people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. \nFirst of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. \nIn fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. \nMoreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. \nAll in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncriminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control, with text span (215, 275)\nthere is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate, with text span (1130, 1220)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ncriminal mind seems to be more related to violence, with text span (1241, 1291)\nif there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease, with text span (317, 370)\nstringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime, with text span (472, 530)\nif a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes, with text span (954, 1096)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nfewer guns available mean less crime, with text span (379, 415)\nthis is not as simple as it sounds, with text span (426, 460)\nmost gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally, with text span (539, 598)\nPeople who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control, with text span (600, 761)\nthe root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself, with text span (882, 941)\nthere will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens, with text span (774, 867) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not?\n\nLiving in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.\nIn terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.\nAdditionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.\nOn the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.\nTherefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ntechnology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles, with text span (523, 601)\ntechnology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles, with text span (2095, 2193)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nIn terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, with text span (603, 730)\ntechnology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing, with text span (1227, 1334)\nsome people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles, with text span (1670, 1771)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwith the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere, with text span (1044, 1211)\nIn the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles, with text span (732, 843)\nThis means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills, with text span (845, 1033)\nChina has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens, with text span (1349, 1521)\nmany tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture, with text span (1532, 1649)\nespecially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques, with text span (1797, 1942)\npeople tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years, with text span (1988, 2061) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGoing to classes should be optional for the students\n\nUniversity students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.\nTo begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.\nAdditionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nApartments vs dormitories at university\n\nMany students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.\nFirst, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.\nSecond, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.\nLastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. \nTo conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories, with text span (309, 406)\nthe advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory, with text span (2142, 2222)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nan apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory, with text span (415, 472)\nan apartment is more expensive, with text span (914, 944)\nthe studying conditions are better in an apartment, with text span (1340, 1390)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWhile in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules, with text span (474, 565)\nYou are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want, with text span (567, 638)\nAn apartment offers more privacy, with text span (640, 672)\nyou can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student, with text span (681, 757)\nyou also get more space than you would in a dormitory, with text span (795, 848)\nyou could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper, with text span (975, 1070)\nTransportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday, with text span (1072, 1162)\nYou could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car, with text span (1164, 1245)\nThe car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination, with text span (1247, 1330)\nyou don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories, with text span (1399, 1479)\nA lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times, with text span (1481, 1605)\nyou would be able to concentrate better, with text span (1701, 1740)\nin an apartment you don't have a roommate, with text span (1613, 1654)\nyou won't have this problem, with text span (1656, 1683)\nyou won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night, with text span (1763, 1874)\nYou set your own schedules, with text span (1876, 1902)\nliving in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them, with text span (1923, 2067) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould professors doing more research or educating students more?\n\nAlthough professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.\nA professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him\/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.\nAs for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.\nFinally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.\nIn conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nRicher nations should help poorer nations in health, education and trade\n\nImprovements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.\nFirstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.\nSecondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.\nLastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.\nIn conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nVarious local languages are becoming extinct \n\nToday, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.\nA world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.\nOn the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.\nTo conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one.

This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.\nThe best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about.

I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. \nFirst and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards.

At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAdvertising - positive or negative part of our lives\n\nNowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.\nFirst, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.\nHowever, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.\nIn conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported, with text span (1894, 1968)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmore good comes from advertising than bad, with text span (1845, 1886)\nAdvertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits, with text span (673, 774)\nto consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits, with text span (782, 836)\na huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people, with text span (1304, 1512)\nadvertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses, with text span (1654, 1719)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nadvertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more, with text span (540, 671)\ncustomers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies, with text span (851, 956)\nthey can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans, with text span (967, 1069)\nadvertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results, with text span (1524, 1641) END"}

However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.\nAs a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people.

These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too.

It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated.

Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.\nIn addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology.

Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.\nThe last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCompetition or co-operation-which is better\n\nThe modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.\nCo-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.\nNevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.\nUnfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.\nHowever, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.\nThus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildren should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition, with text span (2055, 2133)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nCo-operation is essential for teamwork, with text span (375, 413)\nco-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes, with text span (866, 946)\nCompetition helps in improvement and evolution, with text span (1419, 1465)\nCompetition should be always based on self-improvement rule, with text span (1761, 1820)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nEducational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children, with text span (415, 493)\nWe live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success, with text span (495, 570)\nA person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself, with text span (572, 627)\nlions hunt in a team, with text span (643, 663)\nIt is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy, with text span (665, 751)\nco-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate, with text span (770, 850)\nIt helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others, with text span (948, 1021)\nA co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements, with text span (1023, 1131)\ncompetition is also as important as co-operation, with text span (1142, 1190)\nAn individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others, with text span (1273, 1351)\nCompetition has helped the development of science and technology, with text span (1353, 1417)\nevery other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others, with text span (1480, 1569)\nThis kind of competition gives customers more options, with text span (1571, 1624)\nblind and selfish competition is detrimental, with text span (1635, 1679)\n'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run, with text span (1681, 1759)\nA healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach, with text span (1822, 1916) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nImprove roads or public transports\n\nMany people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.\nFirst, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.\nSecond, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.\nLast but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.\nIn short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system, with text span (223, 299)\nspending money on improving public transportation is necessary, with text span (1565, 1627)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating, with text span (308, 386)\nthe using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation, with text span (395, 485)\npublic transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems, with text span (855, 918)\nthere is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting, with text span (1388, 1526)\nit is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in, with text span (1636, 1733)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up, with text span (558, 634)\nCars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource, with text span (487, 545)\nif the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower, with text span (653, 765)\nthis definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline, with text span (771, 845)\npublic transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars, with text span (931, 1005)\nIt means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes, with text span (1007, 1194)\nusing public transportation is much safer than private transportation, with text span (1216, 1285)\nAccording to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care, with text span (1287, 1381) END"}

In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nZoos should be built to protect rural animals\n\nPreserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.\nTo begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.\nNevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.\nBy way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwild animals should be set free from zoos, with text span (1757, 1798)\nanimals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos, with text span (353, 408)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in, with text span (643, 731)\nzoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives, with text span (1107, 1191)\nzoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside, with text span (1235, 1350)\nthey have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression, with text span (1816, 1903)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings, with text span (425, 504)\nGiven the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, with text span (506, 641)\nthe wild species would suffer from isolation and depression, with text span (1032, 1091)\nif rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures, with text span (861, 1017)\nthe limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss, with text span (745, 849)\nthe endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting, with text span (1380, 1455)\nthe strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat, with text span (1487, 1595)\nthe growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide, with text span (1611, 1712) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildren engagement in paid work\n\nIn many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.\nFirst of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.\nSecondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChoosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career\n\nWhen choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. \nFirst of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.\nNevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. \nSome may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.\nIn considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchoosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career, with text span (283, 362)\nparents can lead their children to a more smooth career path, with text span (2281, 2341)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\none can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry, with text span (2188, 2269)\nthey could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information, with text span (428, 538)\nThey have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children, with text span (1084, 1163)\nchoosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision, with text span (1745, 1818)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nas parents are involved in the same environmen, with text span (379, 425)\nmy father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge, with text span (553, 662)\nWhenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting, with text span (664, 725)\nhe has many experiences, with text span (735, 758)\nI could save enormous time in finding solution, with text span (760, 806)\nThis truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues, with text span (808, 863)\nIf I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now, with text span (865, 964)\nthey know which company has better welfare or provides better education, with text span (1179, 1250)\ntheir friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies, with text span (1262, 1368)\nIt is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society, with text span (1370, 1474)\nWhen others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process, with text span (1476, 1636)\nparents have worked in tens of years, with text span (986, 1022)\nthey have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry, with text span (1024, 1082)\nthe condition of job market is completely different, with text span (1681, 1732)\nwhen it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly, with text span (1866, 1925)\nThe condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, with text span (1927, 1991)\nthere is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more, with text span (2001, 2071) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternational aid\n\nThe world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.\nInternational aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.\nDespite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.\nIn conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ninternational aid should be prioritised, with text span (431, 470)\npeople from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary, with text span (1593, 1722)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nInternational aid is critical, with text span (472, 501)\nit is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens, with text span (1123, 1177)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nMany people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards, with text span (580, 668)\nThey lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs, with text span (670, 759)\nWhat is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members, with text span (761, 974)\nthose people are in desperate need of international support, with text span (993, 1052)\nthere is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected, with text span (1255, 1343)\ncharity organisations are mainly funded by the home country, with text span (1190, 1249)\neven within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs, with text span (1369, 1465)\nBy solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth, with text span (1467, 1576)\npeople from other countries may be facing much more serious problems, with text span (510, 578) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose\n\nSome people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.\nFirst of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.\nSecondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.\nLast but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better.

With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.\nFirstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment should regard investing in building roads as the most important\n\nThe population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.\nFirst and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.\nSecondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. \nLast but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.\nIn a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable, with text span (1961, 2063)\nthe most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways, with text span (250, 326)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nwe all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents, with text span (381, 479)\ninvesting in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work, with text span (987, 1084)\nspending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality, with text span (1496, 1565)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThe buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia, with text span (481, 606)\nthe sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing, with text span (618, 676)\nthere are many accidents happening on the roads, with text span (696, 743)\nin my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents, with text span (758, 835)\nVietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan, with text span (848, 975)\nNot only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads, with text span (1086, 1162)\nI always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home, with text span (1178, 1270)\nIt is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour, with text span (1272, 1361)\nif the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions, with text span (1376, 1473)\nAll of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes, with text span (1567, 1639)\nThose bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried, with text span (1641, 1732)\nWe should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents, with text span (1734, 1787)\na part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities, with text span (1796, 1851)\nWhat's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier, with text span (1853, 1944) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInfluence of large factories\n\nNowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.\nFirst of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.\nThe main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.\nHowever, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.\nIn conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories, with text span (378, 508)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\na large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate, with text span (524, 608)\nThe main disadvantage is contamination, with text span (962, 1000)\nhow to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it, with text span (1484, 1587)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTo manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit, with text span (610, 712)\nthe factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area, with text span (728, 858)\nthe estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need, with text span (873, 960)\nIt is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems, with text span (1002, 1168)\nin some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances, with text span (1184, 1368)\nit is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society, with text span (1379, 1471)\nmost problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well, with text span (1597, 1700) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology inspires children's creativity instead of weakening it\n\nTechnology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.\nFirst, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.\nSecond, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.\nAdmittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products.

Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.\nHuman being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOur useful friends\n\nPets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.\nFirst, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.\nSecondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. \nTo sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npets should be treated like human beings, with text span (354, 394)\npets deserve to be treated like family members, with text span (1724, 1770)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npets are our friends as well as certain human beings are, with text span (425, 481)\npets are useful for a variety of things, with text span (1136, 1175)\nthey are our friends and they can be useful in many situations, with text span (1822, 1884)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey listen to us, more than some people will ever do, with text span (602, 655)\nWe can talk to them, with text span (574, 593)\nWhen I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important, with text span (720, 816)\nTalking to my friends was frustrating, with text span (818, 855)\nnone of them have ever felt that way, with text span (864, 900)\nI was all alone at home for a long time, with text span (908, 947)\nmy dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings, with text span (949, 1037)\npets aren't able to speak with us, with text span (1057, 1090)\nwe can nonetheless count on them, with text span (1092, 1124)\nSimilarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone, with text span (483, 572)\nnowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before, with text span (1190, 1251)\nResearchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses, with text span (1253, 1339)\nThere are dogs who lead blind people around the city, with text span (1341, 1393)\npets are important for depressed people as well, with text span (1470, 1517)\nwithout them they could not go around all alone, with text span (1408, 1455)\ntheir presence make them feel better, with text span (1526, 1562)\nthere are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs, with text span (1574, 1681) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWorking Extended hours should restricted\n\nWorking longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, \"Health is Wealth\". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. \nFirst of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.\nSecondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.\nTo conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours, with text span (521, 634)\nI would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies, with text span (1847, 2073)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npeople working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life, with text span (398, 504)\nThis will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person, with text span (2075, 2207)\npeople; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health, with text span (691, 773)\nthese workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign, with text span (1235, 1357)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nBy working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick, with text span (775, 949)\nthey become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons, with text span (961, 1042)\nThe repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life, with text span (1044, 1223)\nthey usually remain busy in their office, with text span (1362, 1402)\nthey do not find leisure time for such social activities, with text span (1406, 1462)\nI would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years, with text span (1478, 1573)\nRecently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries, with text span (1575, 1723)\nHe started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him, with text span (1725, 1827) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould replace normal classroom with online computer classes?\n\nThere are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.\nSecondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.\nLastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. \nIn conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhat's more important: hard work or luck?\n\nWhat do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. \nTo begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man\/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.\nMoreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.\nFinally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his\/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.\nIn the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nany great success need great work not great luck, with text span (2023, 2071)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nluck is one factor in reaching goal, with text span (2085, 2120)\nfamous people are usually diligent people not lucky people, with text span (449, 507)\nwe cannot always lean on our luck to be successful, with text span (1121, 1171)\nThe most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance, with text span (1726, 1844)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nits impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans, with text span (2125, 2193)\nHe do a lot of exercise in football field every day, with text span (1012, 1063)\nit is not for which he is luckier than me, with text span (1068, 1109)\nHard work make you a professional man\/woman which are powerful in his or her job, with text span (509, 589)\nwhen you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success, with text span (599, 664)\nin football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal, with text span (678, 751)\nStatically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty, with text span (753, 803)\nBut I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me, with text span (805, 886)\nIt is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me, with text span (888, 939)\nDefinitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me, with text span (941, 1010)\nit is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam, with text span (1554, 1616)\nIf you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam, with text span (1481, 1540)\nYou cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky, with text span (1385, 1479)\nyou prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question, with text span (1282, 1383)\nI don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us, with text span (1173, 1264)\nyou have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way, with text span (1627, 1724)\nThese plans is done by someone who is mastered in his\/her work, with text span (1846, 1908)\nsuch people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works, with text span (1922, 2001) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nVegetarianism - why some people are choosing to become vegetarian?\n\nSince the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.\nFirstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.\nSecondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.\nTo sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternational tourism is now more common than ever before\n\nThe last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. \nFirstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country's economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.\nSecondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely 'Trong Dong' drum performance and 'Ha Long' bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. \nTo conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe government should allocate more funds to public services instead of arts\n\nThe issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.\nFirst of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.\nOn top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA man 's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues\n\nOnce a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.\nFirst of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.\nSecondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.\nFinally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nZoos have no useful purpose?\n\nHave you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.\nWhen people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. \nAnimals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. \nFinally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.\nThe reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nzoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding, with text span (365, 471)\nzoos are very useful, with text span (2755, 2775)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nin some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities, with text span (2479, 2585)\nThe zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents, with text span (876, 1037)\nVisiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school, with text span (1808, 1885)\na visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals, with text span (1897, 1983)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThis is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos, with text span (2587, 2649)\nWhen people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity, with text span (473, 592)\nIn the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs, with text span (594, 780)\nNowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago, with text span (782, 874)\nAnimals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities, with text span (1040, 1151)\nWe can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience, with text span (1153, 1278)\nIf you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have, with text span (1280, 1441)\nIn the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult, with text span (1443, 1557)\nIt offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies, with text span (1559, 1735)\nit will also help identify which animals could be dangerous, with text span (1747, 1806)\nBeing able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve, with text span (2263, 2427)\nIt is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it, with text span (1985, 2071)\nThis is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs, with text span (2073, 2206)\nIn the present there is a lack of respect for animals, with text span (2208, 2261) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology designed to make people's lives simpler often make them more complicated\n\nMany people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.\nOf course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. \nNext, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.\nAlthough technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above, with text span (1916, 1991)\ntechnologies made our lives more complicated, with text span (505, 549)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntechnologies allowed us to have a convenient life, with text span (1865, 1914)\nnew technologies are always great, with text span (622, 655)\ntechnology destroys the language, with text span (1168, 1200)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit takes time for people to adapt them, with text span (666, 704)\nwe are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, with text span (712, 793)\nmany people often get lost, with text span (795, 821)\nI use new Iphone which I personally think is great, with text span (837, 887)\neven though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently, with text span (898, 999)\nI tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up, with text span (1011, 1074)\nI found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn, with text span (1083, 1159)\nthey created their own language to communicate, with text span (1270, 1316)\npeople used computers or cellphones to chat with others, with text span (1213, 1268)\npeople try to type as fast as they are talking, with text span (1326, 1372)\nthey use a lot of abbreviations and broken language, with text span (1374, 1425)\nThis has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook, with text span (1427, 1484)\nWhat are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions, with text span (1486, 1617)\nmy younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of, with text span (1631, 1762)\nI have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative, with text span (1764, 1854) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIs image more powerful than the written word?\n\n\"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.\nFirstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.\nLooking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.\nTo conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication, with text span (378, 487)\nboth images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words, with text span (1697, 1809)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many, with text span (1105, 1200)\npictures can influence the way people think, with text span (498, 541)\nwritten words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages, with text span (1236, 1307)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nnowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking, with text span (556, 661)\nstatistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit, with text span (676, 799)\nthe magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan, with text span (816, 1007)\nimages are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements, with text span (1026, 1097)\nWith only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images, with text span (1309, 1405)\nthis is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about, with text span (1420, 1499)\nthe primary way of educating students is also by this way, with text span (1514, 1571)\nAcademic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better, with text span (1573, 1682) END"}

Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.\nFirst of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.\nSecondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.\nAll thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSuccessful people try new things and take risks\n\nI have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.\nThere are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can't be always found in books. \nI do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don't take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMobile phone; \"Iron man\" \/ \"Weichat\" - destroy social interactions?\n\nRecently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.\nIn the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.\nFurthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as \"Iron man\". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.\nHowever, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as \"Weichat\", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.\nAfter having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthis great invention causes many social problems, with text span (392, 440)\nthey also contribute to some social problems, with text span (1942, 1986)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nspending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life, with text span (462, 535)\nthe hardship of communication may be developed, with text span (1284, 1330)\nmobile phones have shortened the distance of communicatio, with text span (1714, 1771)\nmobile phones brings convenience of communication, with text span (1891, 1940)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nas people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends, with text span (557, 695)\ndistraction may be developed during study or social activities, with text span (704, 766)\ncontinuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children, with text span (778, 870)\nmany games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours, with text span (1128, 1271)\nIn those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again, with text span (1005, 1112)\nthere are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as \"Iron man\", with text span (885, 1003)\nas lots of chatting apps available online such as \"Weichat\", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication, with text span (1528, 1701)\nWith rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet, with text span (1404, 1512) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDiscuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion\n\nOn these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.\nOn the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. \nOn the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nImproved medical care\n\nAlong with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.\nThe main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.\nIn addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.\nOn the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.\nBy way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages, with text span (270, 343)\nthe development of the health care system helps people have a better life, with text span (1617, 1690)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, with text span (166, 238)\nthe improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people, with text span (947, 1013)\nThe main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health, with text span (345, 458)\nthe increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system, with text span (1060, 1135)\nIt helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old, with text span (1692, 1788)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThey can contribute effectively to the development of the economy, with text span (460, 525)\nhealthy workers can create more productivity, with text span (534, 578)\nthey do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment, with text span (596, 663)\nthis saves an amount of time as well as cost, with text span (667, 711)\na community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society, with text span (726, 844)\nyoung people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy, with text span (856, 925)\nmore pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system, with text span (1144, 1244)\nthe capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, with text span (1298, 1404)\nthey are worth to have good care, with text span (1409, 1441)\nThey have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system, with text span (1443, 1577) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLiving and studying overseas\n\nIt is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.\nFirst, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself\/herself into new environments and situations in life.\nSecond, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.\nAlso, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTelevision and Movies influence our lives both negatively and positively\n\nThere is no doubt that television or movies influence people's behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. \nThere are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people's health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.\nTelevision and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.\nTelevision and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don't prefer it.\nI think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people's behavior in bad ways.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nJury must have access to criminals' past records\n\nIt is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.\nFirst and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.\nApart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.\nIt is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.\nTo conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion, with text span (301, 392)\nthe current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with, with text span (2045, 2186)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted, with text span (2228, 2319)\nit would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal, with text span (550, 661)\nthe convicted will also receive a fair action, with text span (1566, 1611)\nwhen the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized, with text span (1635, 1765)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nknowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment, with text span (680, 791)\ntake a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty, with text span (807, 883)\nThe juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person, with text span (885, 1035)\npunishment can be given in accordance to the condition, with text span (1043, 1097)\nexposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision, with text span (1245, 1421)\nthe juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences, with text span (1436, 1549)\njuries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law, with text span (1165, 1237)\na fair trial can be achieved, with text span (1116, 1144)\nIf finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public, with text span (1767, 1843)\nthe crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well, with text span (1869, 2007) END"}

Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.\nFirst of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.\nSecond, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.\nThird, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSalary is the most important consideration when choosing a job\n\nAlong with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.\nOn one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.\nOn the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFunding artists\n\nNowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.\nThe main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.\nIn addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.\nAnother reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.\nTo sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should help and encourage artists to continue their work, with text span (1747, 1815)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nart is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, with text span (1627, 1734)\nthe governments should help arts, with text span (855, 887)\nculture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art, with text span (1114, 1181)\ntalent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted, with text span (1363, 1423)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nart helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists, with text span (517, 593)\nmonuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists, with text span (608, 772)\nsome countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, with text span (783, 847)\ntheir work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry, with text span (896, 962)\nsculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation, with text span (977, 1101)\nYoung people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts, with text span (1183, 1306)\nnot many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts, with text span (1433, 1503)\nthis type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature, with text span (1512, 1614) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAdvertisements affects on consumer goods\n\nEveryday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. \nWe are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. \nAlso, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEffect of celebrities on youth\n\nYoung people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. \nFirst of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.\nSecondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.\nThus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nfollowing celebrities can be dangerous for the youth, with text span (226, 278)\nwhen young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way, with text span (1524, 1623)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThis has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual, with text span (1625, 1694)\nfollowing celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents, with text span (443, 506)\nthese glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people, with text span (1407, 1484)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nMany young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age, with text span (508, 587)\nin a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes, with text span (602, 833)\nimitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals, with text span (868, 945)\nAdolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior, with text span (1061, 1159)\nrecently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools, with text span (1174, 1366)\nwhen youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way, with text span (977, 1059) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA single international language or not?\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.\nIt is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.\nAlso, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.\nIn spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.\nTherefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people, with text span (238, 357)\na single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication, with text span (2216, 2327)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\na single international language serves an economic purpose, with text span (904, 962)\na universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions, with text span (970, 1053)\nevery country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage, with text span (2348, 2438)\na single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation, with text span (1675, 1767)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\na single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation, with text span (410, 493)\nAs businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation, with text span (495, 693)\nwithout the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them, with text span (708, 891)\nIf people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles, with text span (1055, 1327)\nwhen people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience, with text span (1342, 1557)\npeople may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong, with text span (1785, 1903)\nsome Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, with text span (1919, 1999)\nthey have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English, with text span (2022, 2181) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTaking a break before starting higher education is a good idea\n\nNowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.\nExperience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.\nTaking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.\nIn my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy\n\nThe increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.\nFirstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.\nSecondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.\nTo conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy, with text span (1340, 1425)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThis can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming, with text span (1427, 1525)\nit would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources, with text span (834, 935)\nthe sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming, with text span (947, 1089)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe major source of energy today is water, with text span (346, 387)\nthere is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source, with text span (398, 500)\nTo generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short, with text span (502, 576)\nduring summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India, with text span (584, 672)\nIf the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity, with text span (674, 821)\nthe use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming, with text span (1104, 1201)\nthe use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution, with text span (1220, 1325) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDormitory or apartment?\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. \nOn the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. \nOn the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. \nFrom given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits.

However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.\nFirst of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career.

If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.\nOn the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.\nHowever, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.\nIn my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school, with text span (2298, 2415)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nRelating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job, with text span (465, 529)\nmake a good relationship with them, with text span (1337, 1371)\nif a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, with text span (1392, 1513)\ngood specify knowledge is more crucial for future job, with text span (1661, 1714)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nfriends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career, with text span (393, 463)\nHaving a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions, with text span (531, 875)\nIf top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them, with text span (1037, 1321)\nno matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue, with text span (889, 1035)\nonly if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position, with text span (1515, 1624)\nStudying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job, with text span (1716, 1894)\nmajority of people would choose the former, with text span (2146, 2188)\nit has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future, with text span (2197, 2275) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome young adults want independence from their parents quickly\n\nMany young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. \nLiving in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.\nAnother problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like.

Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.\nThe reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.\nIn addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.\nIn conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nhigher school students should be made aware of the money management, with text span (478, 545)\nstudents understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact, with text span (1791, 1898)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nteenage students need to understand the money management basics, with text span (570, 633)\nhaving exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently, with text span (1640, 1766)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence, with text span (648, 930)\nwhile I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses, with text span (945, 1183)\nif financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized, with text span (1198, 1414)\nbuying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background, with text span (1429, 1526)\nfor a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour, with text span (1537, 1631) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA successful person is one who has earned a lot of money\n\nIt's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.\nMoney is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.\nMore importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.\nIn conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs.

There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. \nFirst and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered.

Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.\nAnother technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEasy preparation of food leads to a better life\n\nThe Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people's lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.\nFirstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don't have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.\nSecondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he\/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.\nAll in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people's lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nease to prepare food has improved people's lives, with text span (1206, 1254)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nBut people should be careful with what they eat, with text span (1327, 1374)\nbeing able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome, with text span (493, 590)\nwhen someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he\/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food, with text span (792, 995)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nsome industrial foods are very bad for their health, with text span (1384, 1435)\nthey should buy only food from well known brands, with text span (1440, 1488)\nthey don't have much time to spend in the kitchen, with text span (438, 487)\npeople normally have lots of things to do, with text span (378, 419)\nif an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch, with text span (605, 780)\nif a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions, with text span (1010, 1120)\nNormally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time, with text span (1122, 1187) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFinancial support for sports and social activities\n\nThere are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.\nFirst, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.\nSecond, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.\nMoreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.\nAll in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthese activities have the same efficient role in students' lives, with text span (387, 451)\nsports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money, with text span (1991, 2061)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThey bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way, with text span (2102, 2205)\nsports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health, with text span (932, 1000)\nsocial activities have same rights to receive monetary support, with text span (1467, 1529)\nthey bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments, with text span (1541, 1620)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nI decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well, with text span (854, 917)\nAfter that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted, with text span (794, 841)\nlast month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back, with text span (707, 792)\nbesides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness, with text span (518, 602)\nour body and moral health depend to physical activities directly, with text span (621, 685)\nbesides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life, with text span (1010, 1114)\nstudents should be prepared to present in society after their graduation, with text span (1140, 1212)\nsocial activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment, with text span (1219, 1309)\nsocial groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment, with text span (1326, 1461)\nIf we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation, with text span (1622, 1761)\nSuch activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends, with text span (1763, 1843)\nmore friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me, with text span (1864, 1949) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo you believe that elderly people used to live in a better world?\n\nChanges are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.\nWe live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. \nThe phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.\nIn conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nin the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically, with text span (2269, 2395)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe people from older generation may claim they had better life, with text span (1980, 2043)\nWe live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place, with text span (460, 585)\nthe increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine, with text span (1797, 1951)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthere were stronger bonds between family members and friends, with text span (2047, 2107)\nthey judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice, with text span (2139, 2199)\nA clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones, with text span (587, 663)\nThe strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts, with text span (665, 803)\nsocial networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago, with text span (976, 1190)\nsome people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication, with text span (815, 952)\nThe phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in, with text span (1193, 1361)\neven some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists, with text span (1370, 1561)\nThe advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives, with text span (1563, 1644)\nscientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough, with text span (1662, 1783) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGrowing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?\n\nIt's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.\nIn the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child's favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child's behaviors.\nMeanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.\nFinally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn't be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.\nIn conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould animals be free or live in zoos?\n\nMany people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.\nMany scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. \nIn addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwe must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment, with text span (206, 279)\nwe have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible, with text span (1347, 1422)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nScientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals, with text span (1424, 1491)\nmany zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them, with text span (1503, 1564)\nMany scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals, with text span (281, 365)\nvarious zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care, with text span (843, 940)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nlike we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts, with text span (376, 457)\nWhen we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts, with text span (524, 661)\nwhen they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate, with text span (670, 805)\nI was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated, with text span (1003, 1058)\nI can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo, with text span (1060, 1166)\nThey beat them up, with text span (1168, 1185)\nthey did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals, with text span (1194, 1306) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFossil fuels will soon be replaced?\n\nAlthough renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.\nFirstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.\nBesides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.\nAdmittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nQuestion about the influence of the media coverage of celebrities\n\nToday, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.\nFame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.\nOn the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor\/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.\nIn conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nparents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity', with text span (1501, 1591)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nchildren may see that this behavior is inexcusable, with text span (799, 849)\ntoo much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions, with text span (870, 998)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ncelebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace, with text span (686, 786)\nCelebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively, with text span (575, 668)\nAs recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor\/actress or a sports star than it was in the past, with text span (1000, 1151)\nMany schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable, with text span (1153, 1332)\nThis may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests, with text span (1334, 1484)\nFame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols, with text span (461, 573) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAlternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion\n\nRecently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.\nFirstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.\nSecondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.\nIn order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.\nIn summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nalternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced, with text span (358, 464)\nalternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion, with text span (2393, 2565)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsome people claim the convenience of automobile, with text span (2325, 2372)\nit is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles, with text span (822, 933)\nthe methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented, with text span (1221, 1351)\nalternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively, with text span (1387, 1507)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nan increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution, with text span (561, 638)\nautomobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, with text span (646, 721)\nthe air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants, with text span (723, 809)\nan increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion, with text span (945, 1020)\nOnce we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while, with text span (1022, 1098)\ntraffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents, with text span (1115, 1213)\nalternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal, with text span (1536, 1623)\nrental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries, with text span (1638, 1709)\nThis system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee, with text span (1711, 1860)\nbicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, with text span (1868, 1925)\nit is a better form to protect environment than automobile, with text span (1927, 1985)\nthese attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution, with text span (2207, 2299)\nthe introduction of international laws can be also effective, with text span (2012, 2072)\nthere are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only, with text span (2088, 2199) END"}

There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. \nIn the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nProfessors should do more research or teach students?\n\nThese days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.\nFirst of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.\nSecondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. \nLast but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. \nFor those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nprofessors should be encouraged to mainly do research, with text span (299, 352)\nit is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research, with text span (2030, 2106)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nWhile extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society, with text span (2108, 2224)\nThe research projects like windows opened to the wider world, with text span (905, 965)\nprofessors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities, with text span (977, 1063)\ndoing research could also improve the teaching quality, with text span (1503, 1557)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nby doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies, with text span (554, 649)\nThe research projects provide communication with the outside, with text span (479, 539)\ndoing research is a method of self-improvement for professors, with text span (368, 429)\nUniversities are relatively fenced environment, with text span (431, 477)\nI still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college, with text span (651, 748)\nHe was often invited to do speech in other universities, with text span (750, 805)\nmy university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects, with text span (816, 903)\nyou could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together, with text span (1141, 1219)\nthere is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages, with text span (1235, 1313)\nIt is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus, with text span (1065, 1133)\nWe all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin, with text span (1315, 1420)\nUniversities positively contribute the professors' success, with text span (1422, 1480)\nWith the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom, with text span (1559, 1675)\nThey can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice, with text span (1677, 1746)\nI still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project, with text span (1748, 1845)\nBy participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments, with text span (1847, 1944)\nThe research project provides a more efficient way of teaching, with text span (1946, 2008) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWe can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject\n\nThere is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.\nOn one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.\nFurthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.\nOn the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.\nIn conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject, with text span (1751, 1951)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmany different characters exist between male and female students, with text span (254, 318)\nboys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality, with text span (333, 407)\nit can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, with text span (1050, 1163)\nuniversities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, with text span (1484, 1589)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nMost of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases, with text span (409, 541)\nthere are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world, with text span (557, 645)\nMany boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts, with text span (647, 767)\ngirls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter, with text span (778, 897)\ngirls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect, with text span (915, 1035)\na girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, with text span (1260, 1343)\nthat does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development, with text span (1169, 1245)\nthis could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects, with text span (1595, 1648)\nIt would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender, with text span (1650, 1734)\nshe is unlikely to focus on her subject, with text span (1349, 1388)\nthis also can block the girl's future development and career prospect, with text span (1394, 1463) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary?\n\nProfessional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.\nFirst of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his\/her competence and value on his\/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.\nSecond, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. \nSome people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his\/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.\nIn conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthey do deserve this high payment, with text span (400, 433)\nhigh salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances, with text span (1835, 1968)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthose who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways, with text span (547, 647)\nsuch high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances, with text span (1008, 1090)\nthe gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair, with text span (1496, 1585)\nIt is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy, with text span (1970, 2129)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\na worker's salary can properly reflect his\/her competence and value on his\/her career, with text span (449, 534)\nThey are not paid for no reason, with text span (649, 680)\nAs we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment, with text span (682, 828)\nIt's all the same in every profession, with text span (830, 867)\nthe richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods, with text span (880, 998)\nMost of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves, with text span (1092, 1260)\nThey shall reap within their high salaries, with text span (1262, 1304)\nif they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed, with text span (1322, 1464)\nas long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his\/her dreams and careers, that would be fair, with text span (1611, 1705)\nFairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment, with text span (1707, 1818) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYoung people move to cities\n\nThese days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.\nTo begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. \nHowever, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe importance of games for adults comparing to children\n\nAs people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.\nThe first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.\nAnother reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.\nTo sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngames are no longer too important for them, with text span (218, 260)\nadults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable, with text span (1733, 1867)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nAlong with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children, with text span (1869, 2033)\ngames become unnecessary for people when their careers begin, with text span (307, 367)\nadults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning, with text span (975, 1092)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nSomeone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life, with text span (369, 448)\nmore often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, with text span (455, 554)\nthey cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago, with text span (573, 671)\nin my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job, with text span (686, 836)\nThey often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives, with text span (838, 930)\nFor youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not, with text span (1094, 1234)\nmy younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt, with text span (1249, 1390)\nadults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately, with text span (1411, 1485)\na competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues, with text span (1496, 1584)\nthey no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities, with text span (1603, 1712) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nBenefits of students' unpaid work\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.\nTo begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.\nAs for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.\nTo sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say, with text span (1396, 1677)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nstudents can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to, with text span (388, 506)\ncompanies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation, with text span (1295, 1383)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nstudents might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation, with text span (649, 772)\nIn most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom, with text span (508, 634)\nthe internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy, with text span (791, 880)\nAs for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money, with text span (882, 951)\nthey can start looking for potential employees and begin the training, with text span (1213, 1282)\nthe younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan, with text span (966, 1202) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type\n\nGenerally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.\nFirst of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance \"a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction\". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.\nOn the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.\nTo conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nGovernment should decide for punishment case by case basis, with text span (1616, 1674)\nit should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal, with text span (374, 479)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nif there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime, with text span (494, 592)\nit is necessary to have a look behind crime, with text span (778, 821)\nfixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government, with text span (1071, 1205)\nfixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other, with text span (1476, 1601)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime, with text span (601, 720)\nlaws and rules are there for people, with text span (732, 767)\nThe person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place, with text span (941, 1052)\nEveryone should be treated equally, with text span (1207, 1241)\nsometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal, with text span (1250, 1464)\na women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction, with text span (836, 938) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould University education be free for everyone interested?\n\nA famous proverb \"Knowledge is power\" has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.\nUniversity is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today's world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.\nMoreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversities should give money to sport activities or libraries\n\nLibraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.\nFirst, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.\nSecond, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.\nLast but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.\nIn spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important.

In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.\nIt is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. \nHowever, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHuman needs vs saving land for endangered animals\n\nIn the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.\nFirst, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.\nIn addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.\nIn conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwe clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment, with text span (394, 456)\nwe definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions, with text span (1809, 1966)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe natural diversity is very important for further generations, with text span (492, 555)\na stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather, with text span (1156, 1221)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIf we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet, with text span (557, 660)\nAs we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem, with text span (662, 795)\nevery day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland, with text span (812, 913)\nIf we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct, with text span (915, 1044)\nfurther generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals, with text span (1059, 1141)\nOur behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming, with text span (1223, 1356)\nThis not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans, with text span (1358, 1423)\nwe are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes, with text span (1432, 1500)\nrecent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average, with text span (1515, 1651)\nThis will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate, with text span (1653, 1743) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA university plans to devlope a new research centre in your country\n\nMost of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.\nFirst of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.\nSecondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.\nAnother reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. \nSome people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.\nMy country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nIf a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one, with text span (238, 441)\nMy country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment, with text span (2128, 2341)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThe centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land, with text span (575, 666)\nThis centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land, with text span (668, 750)\nthe centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve, with text span (828, 909)\nAnother reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs, with text span (1336, 1503)\na centre of business research is more important, with text span (1741, 1788)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmy country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture, with text span (457, 521)\nMost of these lands are left without any treatment, with text span (523, 573)\nEspecially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field, with text span (752, 816)\nThe agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part, with text span (911, 973)\nThe centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products, with text span (975, 1076)\nthe dates are the most important agriculture product in my country, with text span (1091, 1157)\nThe centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms, with text span (1159, 1334)\nshowing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money, with text span (1516, 1715)\nwe have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field, with text span (1797, 1887)\nbeing a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that, with text span (1896, 2126) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFamous people are bothered by the media\n\nSome people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. \nOne reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. \nAnother reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own\n\nDifferent people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.\nA good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.\nThere are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.\nThere are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSchool memories\n\nEveryone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.\nFirst, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.\nSecond, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.\nIn other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life.

Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.\nTo start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe best way to relax is by exercises\n\nIn modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.\nIt is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.\nSports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.\nIn a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions, with text span (309, 483)\nthe best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally, with text span (1590, 1706)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmany activities can let humans relax, with text span (1524, 1560)\nexercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health, with text span (510, 570)\nrigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks, with text span (1386, 1507)\nSports activities can improve mental health, with text span (1086, 1129)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nAny kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system, with text span (572, 710)\nthese sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body, with text span (722, 811)\nThe latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity, with text span (813, 917)\nMany studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises, with text span (919, 1084)\ngood exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens, with text span (1305, 1374)\nThis hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings, with text span (1235, 1298)\nWhen people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine, with text span (1139, 1233) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer?\n\nPeople have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.\nFirst of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. \nSecondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.\nAnother reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAttending university classes should be required or optional\n\nAttending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.\nFirstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.\nSecondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. \nIn conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngoing to classes should be optional for students, with text span (286, 334)\nattending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore, with text span (1704, 1784)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room, with text span (448, 547)\nthey can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well, with text span (1018, 1145)\nthe students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time, with text span (1496, 1612)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nStudent can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand, with text span (549, 651)\nI have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university, with text span (666, 744)\nShe learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast, with text span (746, 808)\nshe rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic, with text span (816, 890)\nshe got very good grade when she was graduation, with text span (901, 948)\nmany times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes, with text span (1165, 1276)\nI had already studied all biology topics before attending university, with text span (1284, 1352)\nI spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry, with text span (1367, 1470) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGetting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance.\n\nGetting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.\nTo begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.\nAdditionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.\nFinally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.\nIn conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents should be asked to evaluate their teachers, with text span (423, 474)\nschool should ask students to evaluate their teachers, with text span (2085, 2138)\nthere are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers, with text span (2365, 2426)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nteachers could improve their performance, with text span (2147, 2187)\nschools are also improve their quality, with text span (2199, 2237)\nevaluating from students could improve teachers' performance, with text span (976, 1036)\nthis evaluation from students could improve schools' quality, with text span (1052, 1112)\npeople who get the most advantage from evaluation is students, with text span (1563, 1624)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey have high performance teachers, with text span (2246, 2281)\nstudents are easy to understand their subjects, with text span (2296, 2342)\nEvaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance, with text span (491, 563)\nevaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product, with text span (578, 710)\nStudents might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information, with text span (712, 819)\nteachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give, with text span (835, 963)\nschool have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students, with text span (1462, 1552)\nin many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products, with text span (1272, 1348)\nthey have employees whose performance are very high, with text span (1357, 1408)\nSchools could produce intellectual students, with text span (1410, 1453)\nTeachers could augment their quality, with text span (1114, 1150)\nWhen school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality, with text span (1166, 1256)\nteachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, with text span (1729, 1833)\nstudents could comprehend their subject easily, with text span (1835, 1881)\nstudents, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life, with text span (1896, 2035)\nStudents could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance, with text span (1626, 1719) END"}

Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. \nSchool is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits\n\nAdvertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.\nFirst of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. \nSecond, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. \nIn conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits, with text span (480, 544)\nadvertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits, with text span (2018, 2082)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nadvertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle, with text span (2196, 2310)\nadvertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit, with text span (560, 621)\nadvertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people, with text span (1571, 1635)\nThere are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter, with text span (2084, 2185)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThe key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control, with text span (623, 727)\nadvertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body, with text span (745, 869)\nadvertising is not the only information source for people, with text span (880, 937)\nPeople can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines, with text span (939, 1039)\nAs long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations, with text span (1041, 1226)\nIt will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors, with text span (1228, 1380)\nin the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods, with text span (1391, 1553)\nThink about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added, with text span (1637, 1809)\nThese are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good, with text span (1811, 1900)\nthe advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle, with text span (1918, 2000) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nExtraordinarily cautious is important since rough work is intolerable\n\nThis current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.\nPrimarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.\nSecondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. \nBesides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.\nTo sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious, with text span (2388, 2441)\nit might not be the most beneficial move to our society, with text span (431, 486)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nrough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive, with text span (2448, 2506)\nwe need to catch up with the pace of the world, with text span (2340, 2386)\nfast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world, with text span (357, 420)\neven when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy, with text span (499, 568)\nEven when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients, with text span (1346, 1542)\nSome work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, with text span (1867, 1912)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nEven simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy, with text span (570, 637)\nIf we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline, with text span (639, 820)\nit only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless, with text span (832, 890)\nIt is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it, with text span (892, 991)\nit may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, with text span (1003, 1090)\nwith consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work, with text span (1096, 1186)\nWe soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace, with text span (1544, 1613)\nwhen the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made, with text span (1620, 1707)\nThis might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start, with text span (1709, 1802)\nother than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality, with text span (1198, 1344)\nA miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars, with text span (2013, 2144)\neven when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems, with text span (2169, 2317)\nin official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic, with text span (1928, 2011) END"}

Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.\nBesides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEffects of mobile phones\n\nNowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.\nFirst of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.\nIt is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.\nAnother debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHigh sum of money of modern artist\n\nThe amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.\nProficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric \"I swear\" become \"underwear\" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.\nStriking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing \"I swear\" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.\nHaving said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nin this occasion the government is not granted to hand in, with text span (403, 460)\ngovernment cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar, with text span (1871, 1963)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nart price is about taste, with text span (1972, 1996)\nProficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work, with text span (462, 513)\ngovernment cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist, with text span (1542, 1607)\nthe huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job, with text span (1702, 1856)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector, with text span (532, 660)\nthe high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent, with text span (668, 781)\na 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production, with text span (796, 893)\nmodern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible, with text span (914, 1048)\nPieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric \"I swear\" become \"underwear\" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me, with text span (1050, 1194)\nHe granted huge sums for such idea, with text span (1196, 1230)\nthe musician re-plays the song without any creation, with text span (1479, 1530)\na musician playing \"I swear\" several times receives different earnings that Padang got, with text span (1384, 1470)\nthere is no certain parameter to value it, with text span (1616, 1657)\nart value is about taste, with text span (1659, 1683)\nlabor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day, with text span (1251, 1369) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAmount of control on media information\n\nNowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.\nOne of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.\nThe major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.\nBoth sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information, with text span (1679, 1807)\nit should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures, with text span (331, 455)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nOne of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content, with text span (457, 562)\ntelevision companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture, with text span (797, 952)\nthe government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases, with text span (1183, 1316)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThey have a serious impact on people in their puberty, with text span (564, 617)\nan internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off, with text span (632, 761)\nA few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser, with text span (954, 1049)\nThis is actually very environmentally unfriendly, with text span (1051, 1099)\nTaking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths, with text span (1318, 1470)\nanother perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest, with text span (1481, 1567) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working\n\nIn everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.\nFirst, the core of group working is \"consensus\". It's the idea that everyone's opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his\/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.\nSecond, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: \"The good medicine tastes bitter\". Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.\nHowever, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.\nIn conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working, with text span (310, 382)\ncriticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism, with text span (2322, 2419)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe core of group working is \"consensus\", with text span (432, 472)\nEven if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism, with text span (1091, 1171)\neven if you are right, criticism is still helpful, with text span (1966, 2015)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member, with text span (871, 948)\nIt doesn't work if one member solely insists on his\/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism, with text span (760, 862)\nIt's every member's duty to respect other's opinion, with text span (950, 1001)\nIt's the idea that everyone's opinion accounts, with text span (474, 520)\nIn group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement, with text span (522, 674)\nCriticism definitely hurts, with text span (1173, 1199)\nit points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them, with text span (1208, 1268)\ncriticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it, with text span (1279, 1367)\ntaking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you, with text span (1011, 1089)\nThose who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved, with text span (1369, 1459)\nif you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works, with text span (1477, 1606)\nAs one Chinese idiom goes: \"The good medicine tastes bitter\", with text span (1608, 1668)\nCriticism might be the most powerful solution to heal, with text span (1670, 1723)\nin this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work, with text span (2024, 2139)\nTaking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all, with text span (2141, 2209)\nYou should have your own judgments too, with text span (2211, 2249)\nAnd it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism, with text span (2251, 2305) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth\n\nIn today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.\nThe first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. \nThe second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.\nIn conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nfatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood, with text span (311, 384)\nfatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships, with text span (1496, 1667)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThe first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage, with text span (386, 488)\nThe second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today, with text span (818, 937)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics, with text span (502, 607)\nin a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child, with text span (622, 815)\nwe are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships, with text span (954, 1087)\na family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society, with text span (1103, 1278)\nall of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals, with text span (1289, 1370)\nhaving and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity, with text span (1398, 1479) END"}
