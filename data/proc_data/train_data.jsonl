{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDistance-learning vs. attending school in person\n\nA matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.\nTo begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.\nNevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.\nBy way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nonline-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions, with text span (364, 506)\ndistance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases, with text span (1814, 1910)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\neducational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios, with text span (1049, 1137)\ndistance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world, with text span (523, 613)\nattending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates, with text span (1413, 1524)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIn earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation, with text span (615, 803)\nNow, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide, with text span (805, 929)\nthe presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students, with text span (944, 1033)\nThanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains, with text span (1139, 1352)\nThey further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life, with text span (1526, 1676)\nIt is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive, with text span (1678, 1769) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPart time job for teenage students\n\nWhen we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he\/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.\nThe main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.\nAnother reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.\nIn sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he\/she is still a student, with text span (327, 406)\npart time job will be good for students, with text span (2017, 2056)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit can destruct students from their study, with text span (1863, 1904)\nstudents can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job, with text span (460, 544)\nfrom part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents, with text span (1253, 1326)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ni did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result, with text span (1918, 1994)\nStudents can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words, with text span (546, 639)\nwhen I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year, with text span (654, 727)\ni had to manage my time efficiently, with text span (785, 820)\nAs i had to spend some of my time in my job, with text span (729, 772)\nI had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework, with text span (822, 883)\nThis taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively, with text span (885, 969)\nI learn money management, with text span (981, 1005)\nWhen my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop, with text span (1007, 1089)\nFrom this i learned, how to manage money correctly, with text span (1091, 1141)\nThis experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things, with text span (1143, 1228)\npart time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially, with text span (1674, 1761)\nBy tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it, with text span (1499, 1564)\nafter taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents, with text span (1576, 1656) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGossip-based information\n\nNowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: \"information is power\". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.\nThe first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.\nSecondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the \"salt-panic\" was over. \nTo conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ninformation is power, with text span (166, 186)\nit is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence, with text span (1662, 1804)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nby using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability, with text span (329, 403)\nyou have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts, with text span (1096, 1184)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nSome people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information, with text span (405, 541)\nRussian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia, with text span (556, 714)\nAfter a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia, with text span (716, 833)\nIt is possible to make a wrong decision, with text span (1186, 1225)\nyou have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong, with text span (1234, 1333)\nseveral years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops, with text span (1348, 1499)\nThe gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the \"salt-panic\" was over, with text span (1501, 1627)\nit is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, with text span (845, 930)\nit can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate, with text span (940, 995) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe best way to relax is by exercises\n\nIn modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.\nIt is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.\nSports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.\nIn a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions, with text span (309, 483)\nthe best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally, with text span (1590, 1706)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmany activities can let humans relax, with text span (1524, 1560)\nexercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health, with text span (510, 570)\nrigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks, with text span (1386, 1507)\nSports activities can improve mental health, with text span (1086, 1129)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nAny kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system, with text span (572, 710)\nthese sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body, with text span (722, 811)\nThe latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity, with text span (813, 917)\nMany studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises, with text span (919, 1084)\ngood exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens, with text span (1305, 1374)\nThis hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings, with text span (1235, 1298)\nWhen people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine, with text span (1139, 1233) END"}

From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.\nTo begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.\nWhat is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.\nFinally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.\nTo sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nbig cities can be a good place for bringing up children, with text span (205, 260)\nToday's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way, with text span (1394, 1492)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities, with text span (554, 631)\nChildren who live in cities have a lot of entertainment, with text span (732, 787)\nthey can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net, with text span (1059, 1140)\nthey can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures, with text span (1235, 1303)\ncountrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc, with text span (1325, 1392)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\neducation is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides, with text span (299, 364)\nin my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life, with text span (380, 541)\nit is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities, with text span (647, 730)\nplaygrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc, with text span (801, 849)\nin countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities, with text span (860, 916)\nChildren who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms, with text span (918, 998)\nin big cities children access to media easily, with text span (1009, 1054)\nVia internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, with text span (1142, 1224) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversities should give money to sport activities or libraries\n\nLibraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.\nFirst, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.\nSecond, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.\nLast but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.\nIn spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important.

Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.\nTo begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.\nNevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe car use will definitely decrease in twenty years\n\nViews differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.\nFirst of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. \nSecond, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.\nAlthough, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.\nIn conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthere will be a decrease in cars use in the future, with text span (501, 551)\nthe car use will definitely decrease in twenty years, with text span (2294, 2346)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is much convenience to take a subway or a bus, with text span (659, 707)\nwith the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not, with text span (1017, 1130)\na personal car uses is in need, with text span (1542, 1572)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe public transportation has improved, with text span (619, 657)\nI live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars, with text span (722, 827)\nwith the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own, with text span (833, 935)\na driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world, with text span (946, 1011)\ninstead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city, with text span (1145, 1314)\na public transportation can't meet every place, with text span (1581, 1627)\nit may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places, with text span (1640, 1729)\nno matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet, with text span (1740, 1933)\nIt not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health, with text span (1935, 2008)\nthis won't be a problem at all, with text span (2023, 2053) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIn personal live, we have some responsibilities towards other people\n\nPeople should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. \nFirstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. \nSecondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. \nThirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGun control \n\nGun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.\nThe first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.\nSecondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.\nThirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.\nIn conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is sensible to enforce the gun control, with text span (282, 323)\nthe guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence, with text span (1577, 1702)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nconsidering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, with text span (1483, 1560)\nmost violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people, with text span (730, 848)\nthe fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates, with text span (599, 718)\nthe possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide, with text span (1203, 1261)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nguns will create a violent society if the trend continues, with text span (862, 919)\nin American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting, with text span (938, 1058)\nsome terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger, with text span (1075, 1192)\nThe accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns, with text span (389, 491)\nwe hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting, with text span (506, 594)\nIn the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent, with text span (1263, 1357)\nthere is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over, with text span (1374, 1466) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGoing to classes should be optional for the students\n\nUniversity students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.\nTo begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.\nAdditionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. \nIn a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngoing to classes should be optional for the students, with text span (418, 470)\nif the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks, with text span (2242, 2335)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice, with text span (294, 383)\nthey have enough ability to read and understand the text book, with text span (816, 877)\nwith the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources, with text span (889, 977)\nsome lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way, with text span (1141, 1209)\ngoing to classes are sometimes waste of the time, with text span (487, 535)\nrather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth, with text span (1665, 1820)\nthey have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time, with text span (1574, 1645)\nfew brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, with text span (1939, 1996)\nWhen the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically, with text span (2072, 2149)\nThey have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do, with text span (2151, 2208)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nsome lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module, with text span (551, 659)\nthey didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students, with text span (670, 741)\nthe university students have grown up, with text span (777, 814)\nfrom the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently, with text span (992, 1130)\nWhen the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time, with text span (1211, 1332)\nIt was waste of the time, with text span (743, 767)\nmost of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time, with text span (1413, 1523)\nStudents need to work as part time basis, with text span (1525, 1565)\nthey can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them, with text span (1832, 1912)\nmostly university has taken whole day for the lectures, with text span (1348, 1402)\nsome are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time, with text span (1998, 2070) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nNew building construction hold the right to gain more money from government\n\nThe housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.\nBuilding more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.\nOtherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. \nGenerally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nWhat government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction, with text span (268, 424)\nnew building construction hold the right to gain more money from government, with text span (1833, 1908)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nBuilding more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need, with text span (426, 493)\nnew building construction deserves more governmental investment, with text span (1279, 1342)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIf the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class, with text span (583, 712)\nordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government, with text span (720, 920)\nwhen they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency, with text span (930, 1041)\ngovernment should spend money on people to rescue them from this, with text span (1047, 1111)\nonly a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted, with text span (1121, 1241)\nPeople cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in, with text span (495, 581)\nit requires far more resource compare to old building preservation, with text span (1365, 1431)\nBuild a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor, with text span (1433, 1610)\nhundreds of problems would occur during the construction, with text span (1626, 1682)\nonly government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness, with text span (1690, 1788) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDisagree Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed!\n\nIt is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. \nFirst and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. \nSecond, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. \nAdmittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. \nIn conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPolice force carries guns - significant impact for level of violence\n\nThe increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.\nFirst of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.\nSecondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.\nIn conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthis trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society, with text span (287, 357)\nit will bring the higher level of violence, with text span (1589, 1631)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nbeing armed with guns in the police force is necessary, with text span (1533, 1587)\na society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one, with text span (1064, 1156)\nThose are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence, with text span (1385, 1485)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwe need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself, with text span (498, 642)\ncriminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs, with text span (657, 820)\ncitizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally, with text span (828, 906)\nwhile on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns, with text span (918, 1051)\npeople and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson, with text span (1231, 1372)\npolice force carries guns only in high crime societies, with text span (1168, 1222) END"}

In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. \nMany governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLanguages' extinction, discuss both views\n\nIt is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.\nThere are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.\nDespite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.\nIn conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nno matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared, with text span (417, 512)\nit will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages, with text span (2063, 2169)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nletting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, with text span (1977, 2061)\nin many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only, with text span (1186, 1356)\nsaving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money, with text span (544, 603)\nthe government should try to preserve minority languages, with text span (1420, 1476)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwe need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive, with text span (614, 724)\neducational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them, with text span (733, 828)\nsome certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, with text span (843, 1018)\nthe local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials, with text span (1023, 1155)\nlanguage can be seen as much more than just one method of communication, with text span (1494, 1565)\nforming a language must be undergone thousands of years, with text span (1580, 1635)\nit deserves to be respected and preserved, with text span (1643, 1684)\nlanguage is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world, with text span (1706, 1803)\nsaving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation, with text span (1816, 1951) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhat's more important: hard work or luck?\n\nWhat do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. \nTo begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man\/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.\nMoreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.\nFinally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his\/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.\nIn the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nany great success need great work not great luck, with text span (2023, 2071)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nluck is one factor in reaching goal, with text span (2085, 2120)\nfamous people are usually diligent people not lucky people, with text span (449, 507)\nwe cannot always lean on our luck to be successful, with text span (1121, 1171)\nThe most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance, with text span (1726, 1844)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nits impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans, with text span (2125, 2193)\nHe do a lot of exercise in football field every day, with text span (1012, 1063)\nit is not for which he is luckier than me, with text span (1068, 1109)\nHard work make you a professional man\/woman which are powerful in his or her job, with text span (509, 589)\nwhen you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success, with text span (599, 664)\nin football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal, with text span (678, 751)\nStatically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty, with text span (753, 803)\nBut I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me, with text span (805, 886)\nIt is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me, with text span (888, 939)\nDefinitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me, with text span (941, 1010)\nit is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam, with text span (1554, 1616)\nIf you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam, with text span (1481, 1540)\nYou cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky, with text span (1385, 1479)\nyou prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question, with text span (1282, 1383)\nI don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us, with text span (1173, 1264)\nyou have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way, with text span (1627, 1724)\nThese plans is done by someone who is mastered in his\/her work, with text span (1846, 1908)\nsuch people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works, with text span (1922, 2001) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOpinions regarding world culture\n\nThere are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.\nFirstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.\nSecondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.\nSome people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.\nTo sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment budget focus, young children or university?\n\n\"Education is the investment in our future\", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.\nConcerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.\nThat's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.\nFrom reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both, with text span (468, 539)\na government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, with text span (1909, 1993)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nboth are crucial on the way to a brighter future, with text span (1995, 2043)\nif countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education, with text span (960, 1167)\ngovernment's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide, with text span (1687, 1840)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\na lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development, with text span (776, 942)\nelementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, with text span (557, 687)\ngovernment should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it, with text span (689, 771)\nResearches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, with text span (1605, 1672)\nfor higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance, with text span (1188, 1331)\nThe high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community, with text span (1333, 1487)\nSome may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, with text span (1489, 1573)\nthis argument is invalid, with text span (1579, 1603) END"}

This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.\nSome people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTelevision has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends\n\nThere are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.\nTo begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show \"Infinete Challenges\". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.\nMoreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ntelevision has more bad than good, with text span (365, 398)\nit is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward, with text span (1765, 1907)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit has made people not to have conversation each other, with text span (407, 461)\ntelevision shows make people forget what is really important, with text span (478, 538)\neven when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television, with text span (1186, 1301)\nIt is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close, with text span (1909, 2008)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time, with text span (628, 708)\nOne who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air, with text span (540, 620)\nthey think the programs are so crucial to their lives, with text span (715, 768)\nOne of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show \"Infinete Challenges\", with text span (770, 924)\nThis is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other, with text span (926, 1066)\nwatching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us, with text span (1077, 1174)\nit is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness, with text span (1402, 1494)\nWatching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone, with text span (1303, 1394)\nit is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together, with text span (1520, 1630)\nIt is natural they behave in that way, with text span (1632, 1669)\ntelevision shows don't require any participation, with text span (1678, 1726) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTeacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects\n\nRecently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. \nIn the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.\nFurthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. \nLast but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.\nIn conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects, with text span (359, 430)\nteachers are the best for children's education, with text span (1680, 1726)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nNot only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world, with text span (1728, 1921)\nschool teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education, with text span (453, 526)\nteaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills, with text span (828, 929)\nit was impossible for them to be a good teacher, with text span (1616, 1663)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nto be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge, with text span (542, 673)\nin comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics, with text span (684, 813)\nafter many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills, with text span (944, 1174)\nparents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way, with text span (1189, 1340)\ncompared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children, with text span (1363, 1447)\nNowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, with text span (1449, 1541)\nthere is only limited time for them to teach their children, with text span (1549, 1608) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIs a break good or bad after high school for students\n\nStudies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.\nIn most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.\nNevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.\nHowever, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.\nImportantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhat is a very important skill a person should learn\n\nSome people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. \nStress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.\nIn the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.\nFurthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.\nFor the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress, with text span (1939, 2045)\nstress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have, with text span (179, 283)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nif we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems, with text span (613, 699)\nstress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization, with text span (1146, 1224)\nit is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body, with text span (1607, 1712)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nStress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences, with text span (307, 413)\nStress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success, with text span (415, 473)\nit is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals, with text span (484, 598)\nSome people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best, with text span (933, 1040)\nother people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems, with text span (1042, 1133)\nIn the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload, with text span (701, 931)\nsome people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches, with text span (1446, 1512)\nMelancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide, with text span (1514, 1591)\nstress takes a toll on our health, with text span (1239, 1272)\nThis is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress, with text span (1365, 1438)\nIt is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands, with text span (1274, 1363) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nVarious local languages are becoming extinct \n\nToday, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.\nA world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.\nOn the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.\nTo conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nusing single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live, with text span (424, 548)\nchange is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one, with text span (1817, 1903)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nCommunication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page, with text span (1971, 2087)\nA world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way, with text span (550, 628)\nfew people are worried about the dying local languages, with text span (1368, 1422)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nDue to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips, with text span (630, 700)\ncommunicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places, with text span (706, 857)\nstudents who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress, with text span (872, 956)\nthey can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment, with text span (960, 1151)\nSingle language also reduces misunderstandings between people, with text span (1153, 1214)\nexchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier, with text span (1232, 1347)\nThese languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures, with text span (1424, 1526)\nThey represent local culture, with text span (1528, 1556)\nAs the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly, with text span (1558, 1632)\nthese languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost, with text span (1643, 1792) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMobile phones: faster communication vs social problems\n\nRecently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.\nIn the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.\nFurthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.\nHowever, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. \nTo sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthis great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society, with text span (272, 348)\nit also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health, with text span (1863, 1962)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmobile phones make our communication faster, with text span (1818, 1861)\nit is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently, with text span (837, 889)\nthe growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development, with text span (904, 976)\nmobile phones have shortened the distance of communication, with text span (1737, 1795)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nas people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills, with text span (475, 722)\ncontinuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture, with text span (734, 822)\nspending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills, with text span (370, 460)\nthere many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature, with text span (992, 1085)\nIn these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors, with text span (1087, 1299)\nfrequent conflicts may occur during communication, with text span (1315, 1364)\nas most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge, with text span (1536, 1729)\nMobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience, with text span (1429, 1514) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFarmland, housing and industry or saving land for animals?\n\nNowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.\nFirst, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.\nSecond, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. \nLast I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.\nAll in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nhuman needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important, with text span (398, 463)\nhuman needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important, with text span (2179, 2244)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nprotecting endangered animals is necessary, with text span (2121, 2163)\nthe needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important, with text span (1103, 1166)\nfarmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life, with text span (1176, 1264)\nit can do good to protect the endangered animals, with text span (1741, 1789)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nland used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society, with text span (520, 602)\nthe economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, with text span (626, 815)\nthey produce plenty of profits, with text span (825, 855)\nthe society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry, with text span (871, 943)\nmore farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate, with text span (976, 1096)\nfarming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live, with text span (1296, 1413)\nEspecially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing, with text span (1415, 1484)\nhighly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life, with text span (1499, 1614)\nfarmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, with text span (1660, 1739)\nagriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy, with text span (1823, 1882)\nwe can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals, with text span (1914, 1982)\nwe can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct, with text span (1997, 2107) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working\n\nIn everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.\nFirst, the core of group working is \"consensus\". It's the idea that everyone's opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his\/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.\nSecond, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: \"The good medicine tastes bitter\". Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.\nHowever, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.\nIn conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working, with text span (310, 382)\ncriticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism, with text span (2322, 2419)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe core of group working is \"consensus\", with text span (432, 472)\nEven if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism, with text span (1091, 1171)\neven if you are right, criticism is still helpful, with text span (1966, 2015)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member, with text span (871, 948)\nIt doesn't work if one member solely insists on his\/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism, with text span (760, 862)\nIt's every member's duty to respect other's opinion, with text span (950, 1001)\nIt's the idea that everyone's opinion accounts, with text span (474, 520)\nIn group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement, with text span (522, 674)\nCriticism definitely hurts, with text span (1173, 1199)\nit points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them, with text span (1208, 1268)\ncriticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it, with text span (1279, 1367)\ntaking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you, with text span (1011, 1089)\nThose who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved, with text span (1369, 1459)\nif you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works, with text span (1477, 1606)\nAs one Chinese idiom goes: \"The good medicine tastes bitter\", with text span (1608, 1668)\nCriticism might be the most powerful solution to heal, with text span (1670, 1723)\nin this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work, with text span (2024, 2139)\nTaking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all, with text span (2141, 2209)\nYou should have your own judgments too, with text span (2211, 2249)\nAnd it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism, with text span (2251, 2305) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople should create a sense of co-operation in their children\n\nIt is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:\nCompetitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.\nHowever, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.\nIn my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.\nTo conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life, with text span (1724, 1830)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nCompetitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently, with text span (409, 507)\nthey shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team, with text span (1262, 1349)\nco-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team, with text span (1571, 1692)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nMNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team, with text span (858, 1006)\nThis factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, with text span (737, 801)\nthey will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, with text span (1173, 1256)\nthose who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead, with text span (1017, 1161)\ncompetitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, with text span (1373, 1476)\nit will not help them to be on the success path for the long run, with text span (1482, 1546) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHumans should be able to use animals for their own benefit?\n\nMan has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.\nHuman being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.\nOn the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster.

My arguments are listed as follows. \nFirst, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. \nMoreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCommunicating via e-mail and voice mail vs Telephone and face-to face\n\nAlthough many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.\nFirstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.\nSecondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.\nThirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.\nAnd finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.\nTo sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncommunicating by e-mails or voice mails is better, with text span (169, 218)\nI would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail, with text span (1631, 1693)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ncommunicating by e-mail is easy, with text span (321, 352)\nyou can write an e-mail at any time of the day, with text span (583, 629)\nwhen you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself, with text span (972, 1110)\nthere is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail, with text span (1338, 1400)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIn this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail, with text span (437, 516)\neven shy people feel themselves more confident, with text span (525, 571)\nMany people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with, with text span (354, 435)\nI might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time, with text span (828, 916)\nfor me it is better to leave a voice mail, with text span (920, 961)\nI get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems, with text span (721, 826)\nI work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day, with text span (642, 719)\nyou can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite, with text span (1125, 1216)\nWhen you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail, with text span (1218, 1323)\nYou should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business, with text span (1402, 1490) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human\n\nWhether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.\nPeople are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a \"new\" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.\nBesides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.\nAlso, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.\nAll in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nhuman activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, with text span (291, 347)\nhuman activity are gradually destroy the Earth, with text span (2035, 2081)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nhuman are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species, with text span (353, 469)\nPeople are corrupting their ecosphere, with text span (471, 508)\npeople are draining the Earth's natural resources, with text span (929, 978)\npeople are endangering other species' live, with text span (1440, 1482)\nit is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives, with text span (2088, 2185)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIn recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies, with text span (510, 622)\nThese wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a \"new\" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage, with text span (624, 761)\nthe industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change, with text span (776, 918)\nThese resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, with text span (980, 1042)\nnowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people, with text span (1054, 1178)\nResearchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted, with text span (1180, 1334)\nAt that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources, with text span (1336, 1432)\nHunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food, with text span (1484, 1548)\nThrough million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct, with text span (1550, 1742)\npeople, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area, with text span (1754, 1833)\nthe living area of other species narrowed, with text span (1849, 1890)\nThis narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction, with text span (1892, 1976) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life?\n\nThere is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.\nIt is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.\nIn tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSchools should only teach children the academic subject\n\nPeople have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.\nMany people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. \nAlthough those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.\nIn conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program, with text span (209, 317)\nthe effects of learning music, sports are profound, with text span (1616, 1666)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nstudents only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics, with text span (344, 415)\nthese subjects might fulfil the students' ability, with text span (1313, 1362)\nthe academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, with text span (1532, 1595)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthese subject are necessary for students' future, with text span (424, 472)\nwhen labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification, with text span (497, 599)\nthe unemployment rate is always high, with text span (614, 650)\nparents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job, with text span (661, 741)\nthere are many things much more important than having a job, with text span (808, 867)\nstudying music, art or sports is also very important to students, with text span (878, 942)\nThis enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them, with text span (944, 1043)\nto get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation, with text span (1055, 1177)\nthrough taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills, with text span (1193, 1300)\nchildren's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity, with text span (1373, 1506) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWorking at home vs Working in a company\n\nDue to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.\nFirst of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he\/she can assemble his\/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one's computer or Internet has any breakdown, he\/she can call the MIS staff to fix.\nSecond, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.\nIn conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nworking at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office, with text span (407, 477)\nworking in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency, with text span (1531, 1616)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nwhile working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly, with text span (493, 571)\nworking at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works, with text span (1001, 1088)\nIt not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home, with text span (1618, 1778)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThink about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he\/she can assemble his\/her colleges right away and discuss, with text span (648, 815)\nThey can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together, with text span (573, 646)\nIt's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone, with text span (817, 883)\nif one's computer or Internet has any breakdown, he\/she can call the MIS staff to fix, with text span (906, 991)\npeople are easily distracted while working at home, with text span (1103, 1153)\nIt's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away, with text span (1155, 1250)\nwhile people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing, with text span (1265, 1371)\npeople who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss, with text span (1383, 1514) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhy should human beings travel to outer space?\n\nFor many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.\nFirstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.\nSecondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.\nFinally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.\nAs a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo zoos serve any useful function?\n\nIt has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.\nSome people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.\nOn the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.\nFrom my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nIn modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers, with text span (1323, 1512)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nrecently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity, with text span (1523, 1720)\nhumanities benefit so much from zoos, with text span (428, 464)\nzoos just take away freedom of animals, with text span (1019, 1057)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nzoos are fascinating places of entertainment, with text span (480, 524)\nthe very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure, with text span (562, 689)\nall zoos serve relates to education, with text span (713, 748)\nMany students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world, with text span (750, 859)\nsome zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct, with text span (871, 956)\nBeing confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented, with text span (1059, 1160)\nzoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons, with text span (1180, 1268) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nParents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else\n\nI completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children's lives.\nFirstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him\/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.\nSecondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him\/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. \nLastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That's as important thing because even if the parents don't intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIncreased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars?\n\nThere is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.\nOne can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.\nHowever, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.\nAnother point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWay to reduce the amount of traffic?\n\nBig cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.\nFirst of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.\nSecond, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.\nIn conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncity planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas, with text span (1556, 1648)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npublic transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street, with text span (458, 539)\nThe city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people, with text span (1441, 1539)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nBuses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options, with text span (541, 676)\na bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number, with text span (690, 802)\nthey will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays, with text span (952, 1010)\nNot to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles, with text span (804, 940)\nhuge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities, with text span (1282, 1439)\nif some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now, with text span (1099, 1260) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAdvertising - positive or negative part of our lives\n\nNowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.\nFirst, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.\nHowever, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.\nIn conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGrowing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?\n\nIt's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.\nIn the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child's favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child's behaviors.\nMeanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.\nFinally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn't be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.\nIn conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA single international language or not?\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.\nIt is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.\nAlso, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.\nIn spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.\nTherefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people, with text span (238, 357)\na single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication, with text span (2216, 2327)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\na single international language serves an economic purpose, with text span (904, 962)\na universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions, with text span (970, 1053)\nevery country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage, with text span (2348, 2438)\na single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation, with text span (1675, 1767)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\na single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation, with text span (410, 493)\nAs businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation, with text span (495, 693)\nwithout the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them, with text span (708, 891)\nIf people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles, with text span (1055, 1327)\nwhen people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience, with text span (1342, 1557)\npeople may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong, with text span (1785, 1903)\nsome Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, with text span (1919, 1999)\nthey have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English, with text span (2022, 2181) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFossil fuels will soon be replaced?\n\nAlthough renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.\nFirstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.\nBesides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.\nAdmittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.\nIn conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nnew forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal, with text span (163, 244)\nthere is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon, with text span (2209, 2281)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ndue to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive, with text span (255, 335)\nthese new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think, with text span (939, 1006)\ncontemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming, with text span (1652, 1781)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nResearches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford, with text span (337, 436)\nfossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas, with text span (457, 512)\nit is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms, with text span (527, 725)\nthe plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming, with text span (732, 844)\nutility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly, with text span (864, 937)\nLatest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards, with text span (1008, 1163)\nthe dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams, with text span (1178, 1311)\nThis damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds, with text span (1313, 1377)\nthe accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations, with text span (1397, 1581)\nrenewable resources are not as reliable as we think, with text span (1588, 1639)\nthese problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions, with text span (1783, 1875)\nwe can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain, with text span (1889, 1982)\nThese improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy, with text span (1984, 2083)\nWith these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable, with text span (2085, 2140) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDistance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom\n\nDuring these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.\nFirst, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.\nSecond, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.\nLastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.\nIn conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMachines - positive or negative for humans\n\nAdvancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.\nIt is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.\nOn other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.\nAfter analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHaste makes waste\n\nThis saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:\nFor one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.\nIn addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.\nNot to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.\nAs can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDetailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society\n\nNowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.\nIt is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.\nAn even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise.

Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.\nFirstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.\nSecondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.\nFinally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. \nTo conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it\n\nNowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.\nFirst, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. \nSecond, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.\nThird, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.\nIn conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nparents should encourage students to take the part-time job, with text span (2247, 2306)\nit is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs, with text span (217, 282)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntaking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it, with text span (2139, 2234)\nthey can teach students many things about adult life, with text span (601, 653)\nwe need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be, with text span (1399, 1468)\nthe part-time job can make people understand future life better, with text span (1751, 1814)\nthe part-time job will effect student' study, with text span (1852, 1896)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmost people they contact with are also students, with text span (436, 483)\nthere are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university, with text span (335, 426)\nwhen students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults, with text span (494, 595)\nMy friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it, with text span (655, 742)\nThrough part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life, with text span (744, 873)\nLisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work, with text span (888, 1058)\nthanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life, with text span (1067, 1177)\nwe do not experience it, with text span (1287, 1310)\nit is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be, with text span (1312, 1386)\nsome questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job, with text span (1480, 1738)\nparents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life, with text span (1188, 1268)\nmost students will do the part-time job in their holiday, with text span (1908, 1964)\nit will not effect on their study, with text span (1969, 2002)\nCompared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday, with text span (2004, 2122) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nForeign language instruction should begin in kindergarten\n\nEducational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.\nTo begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. \nNevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.\nIn conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould parents limit their children watching TV to make them do well in school?\n\nIn 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.\nFirst of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.\nMoreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?\nAdmittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. \nIn considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildren should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively, with text span (502, 575)\nIn considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue, with text span (2330, 2477)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nWatching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents, with text span (672, 800)\nthere are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health, with text span (1780, 1877)\nchildren should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation, with text span (2057, 2169)\nchildren are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies, with text span (2487, 2641)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nchildren generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily, with text span (591, 670)\nWhenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours, with text span (847, 963)\nI could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes, with text span (965, 1066)\nI could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook, with text span (1068, 1180)\nI, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying, with text span (1182, 1251)\nChildren are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, with text span (1348, 1420)\nthey are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity, with text span (1432, 1501)\nRecently, more and more children smoke, with text span (1503, 1541)\nthey imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies, with text span (1550, 1596)\naccording to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies, with text span (1617, 1759)\nsometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children, with text span (1263, 1346)\nit doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching, with text span (2224, 2327) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe opportunity to receive education from university\n\nThere are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. \nWhat is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.\nIn a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLiving with a roommate is better than Living alone\n\nMany single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.\nLiving with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.\nApart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.\nFinally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.\nIn conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI prefer to live with a roommate, with text span (319, 351)\nI prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will, with text span (2190, 2241)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help, with text span (369, 438)\nmany people decide to live alone for various reasons, with text span (2136, 2188)\nit offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help, with text span (2259, 2343)\nLiving with a roommate saves me a lot of money, with text span (440, 486)\nliving with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily, with text span (965, 1028)\nliving with a roommate allows me to get help, with text span (1569, 1613)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIf you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them, with text span (488, 558)\nyou can get more for less, with text span (571, 596)\nlast year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly, with text span (611, 819)\nI was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills, with text span (821, 929)\nIt is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you, with text span (1030, 1103)\nYou can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together, with text span (1105, 1183)\none night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along, with text span (1199, 1256)\nEven though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other, with text span (1258, 1357)\nWe soon found out that everyone loved playing video games, with text span (1359, 1416)\nWe played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends, with text span (1418, 1498)\nLiving with a roommate made socializing much easier for me, with text span (1500, 1558)\nIt often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need, with text span (1615, 1693)\nWhen you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help, with text span (1695, 1767)\nSome of them may have something to offer, with text span (1769, 1809)\nwhen my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help, with text span (1826, 1915)\nThey failed to give me any useful solutions, with text span (1917, 1960)\nTo my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help, with text span (1962, 2037)\nHe was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly, with text span (2039, 2113) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudy at home by using technology\/study or traditional school\n\nI don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. \nStudying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.\nFirst, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. \nSecond, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.\nFurthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nClassmates' impacts on children's performance at school\n\nIt goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.\nTo begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.\nTo add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.\nAll advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements, with text span (324, 416)\nclassmates are unrivalled by the children's parents, with text span (1574, 1625)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school, with text span (1629, 1756)\nthe classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children, with text span (433, 516)\nwhen it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none, with text span (990, 1075)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIn high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same, with text span (518, 746)\nFrom a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances, with text span (748, 977)\nstudents share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others, with text span (1105, 1231)\nit can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents, with text span (1233, 1355)\nSharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension, with text span (1357, 1545) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChoosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career\n\nWhen choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. \nFirst of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.\nNevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. \nSome may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.\nIn considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchoosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career, with text span (283, 362)\nparents can lead their children to a more smooth career path, with text span (2281, 2341)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\none can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry, with text span (2188, 2269)\nthey could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information, with text span (428, 538)\nThey have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children, with text span (1084, 1163)\nchoosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision, with text span (1745, 1818)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nas parents are involved in the same environmen, with text span (379, 425)\nmy father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge, with text span (553, 662)\nWhenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting, with text span (664, 725)\nhe has many experiences, with text span (735, 758)\nI could save enormous time in finding solution, with text span (760, 806)\nThis truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues, with text span (808, 863)\nIf I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now, with text span (865, 964)\nthey know which company has better welfare or provides better education, with text span (1179, 1250)\ntheir friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies, with text span (1262, 1368)\nIt is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society, with text span (1370, 1474)\nWhen others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process, with text span (1476, 1636)\nparents have worked in tens of years, with text span (986, 1022)\nthey have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry, with text span (1024, 1082)\nthe condition of job market is completely different, with text span (1681, 1732)\nwhen it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly, with text span (1866, 1925)\nThe condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, with text span (1927, 1991)\nthere is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more, with text span (2001, 2071) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMore important to work quickly and risk making mistakes\n\nOrganizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.\nTo begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.\nMost importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.\nLast but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.\nTo sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nWorking fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal, with text span (227, 281)\npeople should work faster even more risky, with text span (1955, 1996)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nTrying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice, with text span (357, 517)\nGaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages, with text span (1998, 2135)\nif persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study, with text span (534, 594)\npeople prone to work in two or three firms in a week, with text span (1056, 1108)\npeople who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks, with text span (1445, 1499)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nAttending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter, with text span (596, 722)\nIf people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace, with text span (724, 827)\nI have a friend who was working so slowly, with text span (842, 883)\nHe has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him, with text span (885, 945)\nMy friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working, with text span (947, 1036)\nIf they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money, with text span (1151, 1218)\nThis fact pushes them to work faster and faster, with text span (1220, 1267)\napplying to study abroad needs a lot of money, with text span (1290, 1335)\nI am working in two organization to gain more salary, with text span (1337, 1389)\nthe expenses have been increased, with text span (1117, 1149)\nThe more money, the more chances, with text span (1391, 1423)\nIf you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks, with text span (1501, 1634)\nIf you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder, with text span (1636, 1729)\nIt turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation, with text span (1731, 1799)\nEven if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money, with text span (1801, 1893) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nProhibit public smoking?\n\nThe awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.\nFirstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.\nSecondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafes, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.\nTo sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation, with text span (1488, 1639)\nthe move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run, with text span (299, 395)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented, with text span (862, 961)\nthe image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender, with text span (973, 1101)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time, with text span (406, 561)\nRecent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking, with text span (563, 700)\nA large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases, with text span (702, 849)\nThis example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole, with text span (1391, 1475)\nthe Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafes, hospital and shopping street, with text span (1117, 1242)\nThis step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness, with text span (1244, 1389) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCelebrities & Their Influences\n\nSome people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.\nFirst of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. \nMoreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. \nIn conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYoung people should go to university or not\n\nPersistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.\nTo begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.\nHowever, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.\nTo sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges, with text span (2029, 2252)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nhigher education does not guarantee young students' success, with text span (1968, 2027)\nit is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming, with text span (977, 1118)\nuniversities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine, with text span (1201, 1342)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthere are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, with text span (618, 771)\nlabors for graduates are in short supply, with text span (791, 831)\nthe labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying, with text span (848, 960)\nThese academic values are necessary to the progress of the world, with text span (1344, 1408)\nmany researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society, with text span (1428, 1552)\ndiverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently, with text span (1605, 1690)\nthere are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships, with text span (1699, 1812) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPopularity of mobile phones to young people\n\nNowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.\nFirst of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.\nSecondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. \nThis clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person's education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development, with text span (308, 384)\nthe negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person's education and character, with text span (1701, 1802)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmany young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones, with text span (400, 524)\njuveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic, with text span (1122, 1203)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nGames and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities, with text span (526, 673)\ninternet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works, with text span (686, 825)\nIn my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone, with text span (827, 905)\nI have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends, with text span (907, 992)\nThat goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester, with text span (994, 1110)\nThey would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand, with text span (1205, 1293)\nthey would need their parents to support them financially for what they want, with text span (1417, 1493)\nmost of these juveniles are students, with text span (1377, 1413)\nAn illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents, with text span (1495, 1674)\nthese do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost, with text span (1307, 1362) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEarly retirement for 55+ employees to help younger people\n\nNowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.\nAdmittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.\nHowever, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAre parents best teachers?\n\nIt is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.\nFirst, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.\nSecond, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.\nThird, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.\nIn conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAmount of control on media information\n\nNowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.\nOne of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.\nThe major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.\nBoth sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information, with text span (1679, 1807)\nit should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures, with text span (331, 455)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nOne of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content, with text span (457, 562)\ntelevision companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture, with text span (797, 952)\nthe government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases, with text span (1183, 1316)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThey have a serious impact on people in their puberty, with text span (564, 617)\nan internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off, with text span (632, 761)\nA few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser, with text span (954, 1049)\nThis is actually very environmentally unfriendly, with text span (1051, 1099)\nTaking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths, with text span (1318, 1470)\nanother perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest, with text span (1481, 1567) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAdvertising impact on people's choice of consumption\n\nNowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.\nIn addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.\nHowever, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.\nIn my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nbuying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements, with text span (1691, 1771)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npeople will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life, with text span (208, 298)\nit is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need, with text span (1893, 2074)\nA good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society, with text span (756, 886)\nthe advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, with text span (1112, 1169)\nchildren and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, with text span (1425, 1573)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nin most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs, with text span (313, 591)\nfor children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising, with text span (1777, 1888)\nthere are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it, with text span (892, 1045)\nproducts usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought, with text span (606, 754)\nsometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption, with text span (1171, 1233)\nbuying habit is a very personal things for individuals, with text span (1056, 1110)\nIt is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income, with text span (1235, 1334)\nMost of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase, with text span (1336, 1404)\nthey do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary, with text span (1581, 1666) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment should be responsible for education and health care or not?\n\nDespite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.\nSome people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.\nOn the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.\nPersonally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help, with text span (1695, 1827)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable, with text span (1038, 1146)\nit is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, with text span (1207, 1321)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nsuch people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry, with text span (737, 879)\nIf citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk, with text span (600, 722)\nwithout sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security, with text span (887, 1025)\nit is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens, with text span (343, 439)\ncitizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society, with text span (457, 598)\na great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately, with text span (1329, 1415)\nthe government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address, with text span (1426, 1673) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSalary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways\n\nIt is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.\nFirstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.\nSecondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. \nThirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge.

Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.\nFirst, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary?\n\nProfessional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.\nFirst of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his\/her competence and value on his\/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.\nSecond, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. \nSome people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo modern communication technologies benefit all people\n\nModern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.\nTo begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.\nNevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.\nBy way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication, with text span (428, 550)\nmodern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases, with text span (1794, 1896)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthere are valid arguments to the contrary, with text span (364, 405)\nthese new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind, with text span (1132, 1214)\npeople who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies, with text span (1658, 1755)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business, with text span (567, 718)\nWith the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds, with text span (720, 841)\nit is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world, with text span (856, 966)\nWith a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine, with text span (968, 1105)\nthe more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits, with text span (1281, 1331)\nthe wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money, with text span (1361, 1472)\nAnyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services, with text span (1474, 1642) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nBusinesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life\n\nMany entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. \nFirst and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.\nSecondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. \nLast but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. \nIn a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life.

In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. \nFirstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. \nSecondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome students prefer to study alone\n\nEveryone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.\nStudying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.\nAdditionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYoung people move to cities\n\nThese days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.\nTo begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. \nHowever, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.\nIn conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment, with text span (1625, 1737)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nyoung people tend to study or work in urban areas, with text span (1472, 1521)\nthey move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living, with text span (601, 709)\ncities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation, with text span (1159, 1279)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthese provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials, with text span (1528, 1599)\ncities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas, with text span (376, 456)\nmany large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career, with text span (469, 589)\nif a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time, with text span (724, 926)\nthe burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities, with text span (1028, 1144)\nit might put strain on the environment, with text span (1295, 1333)\nIf there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution, with text span (1335, 1455) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe importance of games for adults comparing to children\n\nAs people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.\nThe first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.\nAnother reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.\nTo sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngames are no longer too important for them, with text span (218, 260)\nadults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable, with text span (1733, 1867)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nAlong with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children, with text span (1869, 2033)\ngames become unnecessary for people when their careers begin, with text span (307, 367)\nadults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning, with text span (975, 1092)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nSomeone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life, with text span (369, 448)\nmore often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, with text span (455, 554)\nthey cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago, with text span (573, 671)\nin my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job, with text span (686, 836)\nThey often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives, with text span (838, 930)\nFor youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not, with text span (1094, 1234)\nmy younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt, with text span (1249, 1390)\nadults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately, with text span (1411, 1485)\na competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues, with text span (1496, 1584)\nthey no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities, with text span (1603, 1712) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLiving in a higher pace is better\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. \nApart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. \nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI prefer to live in a higher pace condition, with text span (426, 469)\nliving in a higher pace is better, with text span (2031, 2064)\nI prefer to live in high pace, with text span (2165, 2194)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite, with text span (2073, 2147)\nwe have to be eager in our lives, with text span (938, 970)\nkeeping our pace higher is important, with text span (1428, 1464)\nwith a slower pace can enjoy their lives more, with text span (1542, 1587)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwe need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam, with text span (535, 672)\nI just failed to participate in the university entrance exam, with text span (674, 734)\nI thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test, with text span (743, 898)\nkeeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy, with text span (1052, 1115)\nIf I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully, with text span (1117, 1224)\nI had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing, with text span (1240, 1373)\nit is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed, with text span (1596, 1682)\nI do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy, with text span (1769, 1867)\nit is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment, with text span (1882, 1972) END"}

Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.\nFirst of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. \nIn addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.\nIn conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ntelevision has more positive effects than negative effects, with text span (262, 320)\nI strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children, with text span (1784, 1871)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe television can have violent programs, with text span (1518, 1558)\ntelevision has useful and educational programs, with text span (378, 424)\nTv is helpful to relieve our stresses, with text span (939, 976)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nif children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects, with text span (1569, 1662)\nit has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children, with text span (1674, 1763)\nNot only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes, with text span (426, 519)\nIf children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it, with text span (521, 603)\nin Korea, there's program called EBS, with text span (618, 654)\nIt is targeted for children to teenager, with text span (656, 695)\nWe can study subjects through EBS lecture, with text span (697, 738)\nthere are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea, with text span (746, 819)\nUsing those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects, with text span (821, 923)\nMany children have a lot of stresses recently, with text span (1030, 1075)\nthey have so much pressure about study, with text span (1083, 1121)\nWhen they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses, with text span (1123, 1198)\nI got too much stress from the school, with text span (1215, 1252)\nI was quite aggressive, with text span (1258, 1280)\nAfter I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone, with text span (1291, 1366)\nthis soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, with text span (1377, 1449)\nit helped me to relieve my stress, with text span (1457, 1490) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTeachers lesson vs other sources\n \nThe way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.\nIt is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.\nOn the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. \nTo put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCapital punishment - necessary or not\n\nCrime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.\nCapital punishment is given only in the \"rarest of the rare\" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.\nMoreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.\nImportantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.\nHowever, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.\nCapital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstrict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society, with text span (252, 316)\nCapital punishment is essential to control violence in the society, with text span (1667, 1733)\npsychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment, with text span (1757, 1869)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nCapital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner, with text span (1871, 1954)\ncapital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals, with text span (589, 652)\nthe rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased, with text span (847, 902)\nCriminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment, with text span (1030, 1162)\nThey can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals, with text span (1270, 1366)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWhen a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment, with text span (452, 581)\nCapital punishment is given only in the \"rarest of the rare\" cases, with text span (318, 384)\nIts first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings, with text span (386, 450)\ncapital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes, with text span (664, 742)\nWhen a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes, with text span (744, 839)\ncapital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals, with text span (917, 1028)\nthe jury giving the verdict are also humans, with text span (1173, 1216)\nThey have the life of a person at their discretion, with text span (1218, 1268)\nThe jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime, with text span (1368, 1450)\nif an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous, with text span (1465, 1548)\nOnly deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment, with text span (1550, 1665) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nRoles of international sports events\n\nWhenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.\nFirst and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.\nSecondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.\nIn conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npopular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely, with text span (252, 358)\ninternational sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely, with text span (2130, 2293)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries, with text span (498, 586)\nsport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations, with text span (752, 892)\nsport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen, with text span (2034, 2113)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nsports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another, with text span (380, 489)\na large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, with text span (596, 666)\nthere are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures, with text span (668, 736)\nAfter sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations, with text span (894, 1105)\nsporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators, with text span (1117, 1220)\nSeeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete, with text span (1222, 1304)\nThe athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country, with text span (1306, 1424)\nWhen witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness, with text span (1426, 1540)\nwhen Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets, with text span (1556, 1677)\nPeople from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President, with text span (1679, 1796)\nThe eager atmosphere lasted many next days, with text span (1798, 1840)\nsome hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally, with text span (1851, 1946)\nthe hooligans only took a minority of people, with text span (1957, 2001) END"}

However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. \nFirstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. \nOn the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.\nTo my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs.

The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team.

Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. \nSchool is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age.

Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.\nFirst of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.\nSecondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.\nAll thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact.

Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.\nSpecifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.\nAs illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season.

Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.\nTaxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.\nSome people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.\nTaking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes.

Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. \nConsideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.\nMoreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.\nIn conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSchool memories\n\nEveryone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.\nFirst, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.\nSecond, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.\nIn other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTV has adverse effects on friends and family\n\nNowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.\nFirst of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.\nAnother way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.\nFinally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. \nAs I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nTelevision has destroyed communication among friends and family, with text span (249, 312)\ntelevision has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television, with text span (1901, 2072)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nSome People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority, with text span (314, 449)\ntelevision is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, with text span (1807, 1882)\nsome people spend a lot of time watching television, with text span (465, 516)\nAnother way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family, with text span (1036, 1168)\nsome people make the television a priority, with text span (1549, 1591)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nshe is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email, with text span (866, 929)\nSometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials, with text span (760, 860)\nInstead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours, with text span (518, 603)\nTime with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them, with text span (931, 1034)\nI know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours, with text span (605, 758)\nThis is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns, with text span (1170, 1283)\nwhen there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation, with text span (1291, 1372)\nthe television is again in between them, with text span (1381, 1420)\nWhen family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases, with text span (1422, 1538)\nI remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night, with text span (1593, 1731) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInfluence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages\n\nIn the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.\nNo one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.\nAdmittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.\nIn conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit's a reasonable loss in globalization, with text span (226, 265)\nI'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around, with text span (1583, 1691)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nNo one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally, with text span (362, 451)\nthe culture heritage and nation identity vanish, with text span (1383, 1430)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ncommunication between countries and cultures become convenient, with text span (468, 530)\nIn my country, English is a required course from elementary school, with text span (532, 598)\nstudying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters, with text span (606, 662)\nlanguage obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country, with text span (674, 810)\nenhances relationship and promotes international business, with text span (827, 884)\nresearchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English, with text span (899, 1016)\nTaking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English, with text span (1018, 1098)\nIt's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides, with text span (1100, 1199)\nthey have no choice but choosing English as a second language, with text span (1214, 1275)\nEnglish is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year, with text span (1314, 1374)\nthis is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society, with text span (1441, 1531) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYounger school children should study art and music\n\nUndoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.\nFirst of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. \nIn addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.\nAdmittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.\nIn a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe art and music should be required to study, with text span (633, 678)\nyounger students' art and music education should not take the second place, with text span (2659, 2733)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life, with text span (349, 443)\nart and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful, with text span (694, 774)\nstudying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax, with text span (1311, 1400)\nthe school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure, with text span (2328, 2492)\nin the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, with text span (2509, 2657)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthose subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays, with text span (452, 587)\nIt is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures, with text span (776, 966)\nlearning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures, with text span (993, 1140)\nstudents are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played, with text span (1156, 1295)\nwith the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself, with text span (1413, 1624)\nArt and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life, with text span (1626, 1751)\nWhen enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for, with text span (1753, 1970)\nthey would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved, with text span (1988, 2080)\nthis sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art, with text span (2094, 2157)\nthe study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest, with text span (2171, 2251)\nThe education of art and music would not work if students resist it, with text span (2253, 2320) END"}

First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older.

Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYour job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does\n\nWith the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.\nAdmittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. \nHowever, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. \nSecond, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.\nIn conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nliving environment is more important than job for most of us, with text span (290, 350)\nit is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work, with text span (1951, 2034)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\njob can bring us happiness, with text span (364, 390)\njob can provide money to us, with text span (553, 580)\npeople should concern more about their living environment than job, with text span (592, 658)\nbeautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people, with text span (1108, 1221)\nthe goal people is for good livers, with text span (2041, 2075)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nPeople can receive a sense of values and respected from job, with text span (392, 451)\nIf people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence, with text span (453, 538)\nfor most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives, with text span (667, 723)\nFew people can feel happiness from their job, with text span (725, 769)\nthey have to continue to work more than 30 years, with text span (778, 826)\nWorkers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day, with text span (841, 971)\nThese labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness, with text span (973, 1037)\nthey feel tired and frustrated after long hour work, with text span (1046, 1097)\nWithout beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety, with text span (1223, 1313)\nNowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly, with text span (1315, 1409)\nFactories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil, with text span (1411, 1474)\nIn order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests, with text span (1476, 1539)\nIn China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick, with text span (1541, 1617)\nthese factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people, with text span (1626, 1713)\nlocal residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, with text span (1727, 1823)\nthey cannot feel happiness from high-paying job, with text span (1825, 1872)\nmost of them suffer from cancer or other diseases, with text span (1885, 1934) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system\n\nSome people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.\nFirstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.\nSecondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.\nMany parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.\nOn the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthese taxes are absolutely essential, with text span (267, 303)\ntaxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in, with text span (1662, 1791)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nby paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor, with text span (314, 435)\nthe tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital, with text span (741, 850)\nsuch tax payments are unfair for them, with text span (1304, 1341)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmany poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course, with text span (453, 541)\nWith the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life, with text span (543, 729)\nthis reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation, with text span (863, 925)\nthe government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue, with text span (938, 1038)\nthe government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care, with text span (1053, 1237)\nit is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use, with text span (1363, 1432)\nwe also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade, with text span (1448, 1561)\nWe certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes, with text span (1563, 1628) END"}

However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.\nFirst of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.\nSecondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.\nIn sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people\n\nAlthough developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.\nFirst, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.\nSecond, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.\nLastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.\nIn conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nParents are our teachers from the very early time in our life\n\nLearning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.\nFirstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.\nSecondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLuck vs hard work\n\nThere are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.\nFirst, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.\nSecondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. \nThirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. \nAlthough it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is one's hard work that helps him reach his target, with text span (244, 297)\nI strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does, with text span (2349, 2443)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nI do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals, with text span (125, 192)\ndepending on luck for everything is not good, with text span (2297, 2341)\nif you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk, with text span (306, 390)\nall my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck, with text span (687, 750)\nthose who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination, with text span (936, 1033)\nif you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target, with text span (1588, 1700)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is good to be lucky, with text span (2273, 2295)\nLuck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way, with text span (392, 478)\nIf it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment, with text span (480, 534)\nI never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals, with text span (756, 817)\nif you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal, with text span (544, 658)\nThey carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal, with text span (1035, 1169)\nIf you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading, with text span (1171, 1244)\na friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery, with text span (1259, 1399)\nHe was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery, with text span (1401, 1486)\nup to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened, with text span (1497, 1576)\nmy boss worked tirelessly for his promotion, with text span (1715, 1758)\nHe looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion, with text span (1760, 1829)\nHe realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors, with text span (1831, 1938)\nhe had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply, with text span (1949, 2065)\nAt the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship, with text span (2067, 2195)\nhe had more credentials than other officers in his capacity, with text span (2202, 2261) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternational tourism is now more common than ever before\n\nThe last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. \nFirstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country's economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.\nSecondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely 'Trong Dong' drum performance and 'Ha Long' bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. \nTo conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations, with text span (352, 475)\ninternational tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries, with text span (1568, 1701)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country, with text span (955, 1012)\ntourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes, with text span (1454, 1526)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ninternational tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country's economy in order to serve various demands of tourists, with text span (487, 613)\nTake Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores, with text span (615, 784)\nThese demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard, with text span (786, 943)\nthrough tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected, with text span (1024, 1135)\nin Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely 'Trong Dong' drum performance and 'Ha Long' bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry, with text span (1151, 1329)\nWithout this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works, with text span (1331, 1446) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhether it is better to have broad knowledge or not\n\nViews differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.\nFirst of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.\nSecond, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.\nAlthough I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can't success one's own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won't be a problem at all.\nIn conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nhaving a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success, with text span (512, 577)\na broad knowledge of different subjects is really important, with text span (2481, 2540)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nwhen one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier, with text span (631, 716)\nwhen you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields, with text span (1267, 1371)\nif one can't success one's own major, what else things he can do in different filed, with text span (1974, 2057)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nI have studied some of the engineering courses, with text span (1061, 1107)\nWhile some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, with text span (935, 1053)\nIt is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need, with text span (1109, 1257)\nThanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art, with text span (1539, 1635)\nThings ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank, with text span (1637, 1768)\nwhat if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed, with text span (2125, 2194) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThere will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms\n\nIn recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.\nThere are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.\nSecondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm - the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.\nIn conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers, with text span (171, 294)\nthere can be no school without a teacher, with text span (1627, 1667)\ncomputers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place, with text span (1682, 1790)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nTeachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs, with text span (1792, 1862)\ncomputers need to be operated by people, with text span (381, 420)\nchildren need human interactions, with text span (963, 995)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch, with text span (867, 951)\nscientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching, with text span (671, 785)\nlessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector, with text span (520, 660)\nNo one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today, with text span (422, 505)\nAs a recent interview with Josh Trumm - the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper educatio, with text span (1119, 1383)\nWithout someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn', with text span (1386, 1478)\nonly a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model, with text span (1538, 1610)\nNo matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils, with text span (997, 1117) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnological progress in the past century has its negative effect\n\nIn the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.\nOn one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.\nBesides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.\nOn the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.\nIn conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit still provides us with much more advantages, with text span (1841, 1887)\nthere were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, with text span (93, 229)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntechnological progress causes corresponding problems, with text span (1787, 1839)\nthe development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards, with text span (288, 384)\nadvanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard, with text span (781, 870)\nthe development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society, with text span (1272, 1373)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nScientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity, with text span (386, 505)\nBecause of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions, with text span (507, 656)\nThis also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue, with text span (658, 770)\nWith the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control, with text span (872, 1059)\nwe could get more happiness from technology, with text span (1208, 1251)\nDigital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, with text span (1061, 1186)\nPeople utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions, with text span (1375, 1563)\nThis would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment, with text span (1565, 1626)\nVehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities, with text span (1628, 1761) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nJury must have access to criminals' past records\n\nIt is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.\nFirst and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.\nApart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.\nIt is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.\nTo conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion, with text span (301, 392)\nthe current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with, with text span (2045, 2186)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted, with text span (2228, 2319)\nit would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal, with text span (550, 661)\nthe convicted will also receive a fair action, with text span (1566, 1611)\nwhen the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized, with text span (1635, 1765)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nknowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment, with text span (680, 791)\ntake a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty, with text span (807, 883)\nThe juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person, with text span (885, 1035)\npunishment can be given in accordance to the condition, with text span (1043, 1097)\nexposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision, with text span (1245, 1421)\nthe juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences, with text span (1436, 1549)\njuries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law, with text span (1165, 1237)\na fair trial can be achieved, with text span (1116, 1144)\nIf finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public, with text span (1767, 1843)\nthe crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well, with text span (1869, 2007) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo married women usually work? Why and why not?\n\nPersonally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.\nFirstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.\nSecondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.\nLast but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.\nIn conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nmarried women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly, with text span (76, 212)\nmarried women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home, with text span (1439, 1521)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nWorking outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household, with text span (214, 305)\nit is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money, with text span (635, 701)\na well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long, with text span (1355, 1434)\nit is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better, with text span (996, 1064)\nthere are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work, with text span (1096, 1175)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nextra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses, with text span (364, 435)\nBy taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life, with text span (437, 510)\nThis is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present, with text span (512, 629)\nworking outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity, with text span (713, 862)\nThese things in turn will make them more confident, independent, with text span (864, 927)\nThese women will set a good example for their children, with text span (929, 983)\nBesides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women, with text span (1177, 1338) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAdvertisements affects on consumer goods\n\nEveryday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. \nWe are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. \nAlso, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudents should attend to classes or it should be optional?\n\nNowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.\nFirst and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. \nAnother significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. \nFinally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class's disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. \nOn the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nbeing present at classes seems a wiser option, with text span (530, 575)\ncommunicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials, with text span (1985, 2064)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nbeing present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college, with text span (618, 818)\nby the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier, with text span (1084, 1156)\nappearing in class makes students more conscientious, with text span (1492, 1544)\nteachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it, with text span (2076, 2216)\nattending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success, with text span (2224, 2356)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey can help each other for learning materials better, with text span (826, 880)\nif they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems, with text span (891, 1007)\nteachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points, with text span (1163, 1273)\nIn this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study, with text span (1275, 1464)\nthey have to obey class's disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments, with text span (1551, 1672)\nthe ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times, with text span (1683, 1821)\nthey may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study, with text span (1841, 1921) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCreative Artists\n\nInnovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.\nOne of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.\nLet's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide - these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.\nBy way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas - this world needs them to make itself colourful.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nfreedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create, with text span (265, 406)\nthey should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas, with text span (2051, 2110)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthis world needs them to make itself colourful, with text span (2113, 2159)\nOne of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society, with text span (408, 546)\nrestrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply, with text span (1566, 1618)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work, with text span (567, 668)\nart inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning, with text span (697, 917)\nIf the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value, with text span (919, 1062)\nthe notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified, with text span (1286, 1348)\nsome of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc, with text span (1444, 1540)\nadolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents, with text span (1622, 1699)\nin the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide - these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art, with text span (1710, 1934) END"}

There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.\nOn one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.\nBesides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.\nOn the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment.

I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.\nUniversity is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today's world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.\nMoreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople will spend less time on cooking food\n\nPerhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.\nThe first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.\nAnother reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.\nSome people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.\nTo sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople are likely to spend less time in cooking food, with text span (271, 323)\npeople will spend less time in cooking food, with text span (2788, 2831)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future, with text span (1119, 1205)\nmost of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants, with text span (1230, 1286)\ninvesting much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family, with text span (1851, 1955)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\npeople nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years, with text span (717, 829)\nwith the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time, with text span (468, 702)\nin recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework, with text span (841, 1016)\nAnd this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology, with text span (1018, 1111)\nthey find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal, with text span (1646, 1700)\n89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on, with text span (1401, 1638)\nEven they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study, with text span (1702, 1822)\nit is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time, with text span (2478, 2576)\nas a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality, with text span (1994, 2102)\nhealth and life of eaters is assured, with text span (2245, 2281)\nEven, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, with text span (2104, 2238)\nalong with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities, with text span (2292, 2462)\nthey want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves, with text span (1295, 1369) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not?\n\nLiving in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.\nIn terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.\nAdditionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.\nOn the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.\nTherefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles.

Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive.

There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.\nMoreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life.

In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.\nFirst, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.\nSecond, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.\nAdmittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. \nBased on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe convenience it brings is more, with text span (366, 399)\nthe convenience it brings in people's are significant, with text span (2046, 2099)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntechnology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, with text span (303, 364)\nwhen it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler, with text span (461, 589)\ntechnology also makes teaching simpler, with text span (856, 894)\ntechnology may make people's life more complicated, with text span (1325, 1375)\ntechnology may make people's life complicated in some cases, with text span (1985, 2044)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWith a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle, with text span (591, 684)\nif you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times, with text span (701, 846)\nIn the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers, with text span (896, 1050)\nWith the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, with text span (1052, 1147)\nall the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once, with text span (1163, 1295)\nthe cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications, with text span (1390, 1559)\nfolks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them, with text span (1575, 1691)\ngames on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones, with text span (1706, 1837)\nmaking their life more complicated and tired, with text span (1853, 1897) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHigher education should be available only to good students or not\n\nNo one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.\nFirst of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.\nOn the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.\nIn conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPrepared Food\n\nNowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.\nFirst of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.\nNot cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.\nIn addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.\nIn conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits, with text span (193, 383)\nit is not a good thing, with text span (1852, 1874)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society, with text span (104, 183)\neasy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health, with text span (911, 977)\nNot cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition, with text span (979, 1041)\nthe invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, with text span (1745, 1850)\nThe more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose, with text span (1348, 1409)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nto make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people, with text span (501, 676)\ningredients being added have caused dire consequences, with text span (683, 736)\nthere are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases, with text span (752, 903)\nWhereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up, with text span (1137, 1295)\nAt the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes, with text span (1411, 1558)\nrare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking, with text span (1564, 1719) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe internet provides a lot of valuable information\n\nIn the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.\nFirst of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.\nIn addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.\nLast but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.\nTo conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLarge amount of violence in television programs\n\nExcessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. \nAdmittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children's television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.\nNevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults' civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. \nIn conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable, with text span (306, 491)\nviolent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency, with text span (1800, 1908)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies, with text span (1059, 1216)\nit would certainly be a violation of adults' civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences, with text span (1232, 1406)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nreducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate, with text span (506, 615)\ngovernments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children's television programs, with text span (676, 774)\nAs a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, with text span (776, 874)\nby watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes, with text span (902, 1046)\nadults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day, with text span (1420, 1500)\nFor whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment, with text span (1502, 1581)\nConsidering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them, with text span (1583, 1761) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLearning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives\n\nThere are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.\nFirst, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. \nSecond, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. \nMoreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. \nAll in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nlearning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives, with text span (336, 408)\nlearning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life, with text span (1636, 1717)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better, with text span (748, 835)\nit would improve students' social behavior, with text span (846, 888)\nwhen a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently, with text span (1352, 1451)\nStudents would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc, with text span (1758, 1903)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations, with text span (476, 599)\nmore information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts, with text span (621, 733)\nif they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life, with text span (1099, 1234)\nIf students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well, with text span (890, 992)\nThey should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well, with text span (994, 1091)\nIt can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position, with text span (1535, 1597)\nconcerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life, with text span (1470, 1533)\nthese way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts, with text span (1247, 1329) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own\n\nDifferent people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.\nA good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.\nThere are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.\nThere are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDrivers have to pay a fee for driving in Rush Hour\n\nStarted in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. \nCapitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.\nBuying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.\nRather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. \nIn conclusion, \"rush hours\" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nno additional payment should be charged on them, with text span (470, 517)\ncharging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational, with text span (2347, 2425)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\n\"rush hours\" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers, with text span (2196, 2258)\ncharging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction, with text span (791, 856)\nCharging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous, with text span (1327, 1389)\ncharging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful, with text span (2078, 2178)\nRather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil, with text span (1568, 1855)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nCapitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them, with text span (552, 652)\nDriving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, with text span (654, 772)\ntraffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban, with text span (886, 956)\nit is out of drivers' control, with text span (961, 990)\nWars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries, with text span (1076, 1170)\nBuying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear, with text span (1172, 1325)\ncharging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights, with text span (1471, 1566)\nMajority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, with text span (1391, 1465)\nSometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways, with text span (1857, 1973)\nthe one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers, with text span (1991, 2064) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nZoos should be built to protect rural animals\n\nPreserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.\nTo begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.\nNevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.\nBy way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwild animals should be set free from zoos, with text span (1757, 1798)\nanimals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos, with text span (353, 408)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in, with text span (643, 731)\nzoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives, with text span (1107, 1191)\nzoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside, with text span (1235, 1350)\nthey have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression, with text span (1816, 1903)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings, with text span (425, 504)\nGiven the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, with text span (506, 641)\nthe wild species would suffer from isolation and depression, with text span (1032, 1091)\nif rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures, with text span (861, 1017)\nthe limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss, with text span (745, 849)\nthe endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting, with text span (1380, 1455)\nthe strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat, with text span (1487, 1595)\nthe growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide, with text span (1611, 1712) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFactor of choosing a career.\n\nIn many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.\nTo begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.\nFurther and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthere are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard, with text span (189, 268)\nI disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, with text span (1318, 1385)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe salary is very pivotal factor, with text span (141, 174)\nthere are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements, with text span (1390, 1512)\nin order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well, with text span (298, 380)\ncareer promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary, with text span (948, 1116)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nPeople, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary, with text span (543, 690)\naspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life, with text span (391, 541)\nmost of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach, with text span (808, 930)\npeople, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries, with text span (1131, 1301) END"}

While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. \nFirst, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. \nSecond, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. \nFinally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncomputers brought convenience and easiness to our life, with text span (332, 386)\ncomputers have made life easier and more convenient, with text span (1898, 1949)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication, with text span (393, 479)\ncomputers through internet made our access to information easier, with text span (489, 553)\ncommunication has become cheaper, faster and visual, with text span (1820, 1871)\nit broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways, with text span (1967, 2102)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwith the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources, with text span (1018, 1127)\nThrough computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed, with text span (555, 686)\nSearch engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes, with text span (688, 846)\nSocial networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments, with text span (848, 1009)\nin a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper, with text span (1138, 1229)\nWith the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes, with text span (1231, 1336)\nit is convenient, with text span (1351, 1367)\nyou do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world, with text span (1376, 1572)\nInternet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible, with text span (1574, 1647)\nvia skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities, with text span (1662, 1807) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHigher school students should be taught how to manage money\n\nThere is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.\nThe reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.\nIn addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.\nIn conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nhigher school students should be made aware of the money management, with text span (478, 545)\nstudents understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact, with text span (1791, 1898)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nteenage students need to understand the money management basics, with text span (570, 633)\nhaving exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently, with text span (1640, 1766)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence, with text span (648, 930)\nwhile I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses, with text span (945, 1183)\nif financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized, with text span (1198, 1414)\nbuying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background, with text span (1429, 1526)\nfor a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour, with text span (1537, 1631) END"}

Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.\nSecond, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.\nTelephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGiving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect\n\nIn this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.\nFirst of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.\nSecondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.\nThird, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.\nIn conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\naiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons, with text span (664, 761)\nbeing a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live, with text span (2322, 2477)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthere are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy, with text span (2104, 2296)\njust giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries, with text span (422, 507)\na great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries, with text span (522, 640)\nAiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business, with text span (1071, 1174)\naiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people, with text span (1402, 1465)\nthe campaigns might include practical benefits, with text span (1741, 1787)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\npoor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer, with text span (777, 884)\nTo be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies, with text span (886, 1069)\nrepublic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's, with text span (1187, 1279)\nNow that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties, with text span (1281, 1390)\nIf people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted, with text span (1467, 1600)\nIt not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization, with text span (1602, 1732)\nIn globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others, with text span (1789, 1899)\nWhen America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt, with text span (1901, 2087) END"}

Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics.

Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss.

Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. \nOn the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPhysical exercise\n\nAlthough some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. \nFirst of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: \"Anima sana in corpore sano\", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.\nBesides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. \nLast, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.\nIn the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe physical education part should not be outweighed, with text span (147, 199)\nthe more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students, with text span (2111, 2240)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nPhysical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country, with text span (201, 350)\nif the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation, with text span (795, 938)\nwhen we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer, with text span (949, 1027)\nfinancial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is, with text span (1470, 1554)\nputting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society, with text span (1897, 2007)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nhealthy body is basis for healthy soul, with text span (446, 484)\nThere is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises, with text span (486, 581)\nThe more we practice, the better we feel, with text span (583, 623)\nthere is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better, with text span (639, 789)\nwhen a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation, with text span (1042, 1147)\nthe school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically, with text span (1156, 1322)\nalmost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education, with text span (1337, 1446)\nthe money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, with text span (1570, 1657)\nthe nation is comparatively healthy, with text span (1665, 1700)\nphysically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development, with text span (1719, 1808)\nthe better a person feels, the better his brain works, with text span (1831, 1884)\nit ends up with financially competitive country, with text span (2018, 2065) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIs image more powerful than the written word?\n\n\"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.\nFirstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.\nLooking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.\nTo conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication, with text span (378, 487)\nboth images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words, with text span (1697, 1809)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many, with text span (1105, 1200)\npictures can influence the way people think, with text span (498, 541)\nwritten words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages, with text span (1236, 1307)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nnowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking, with text span (556, 661)\nstatistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit, with text span (676, 799)\nthe magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan, with text span (816, 1007)\nimages are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements, with text span (1026, 1097)\nWith only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images, with text span (1309, 1405)\nthis is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about, with text span (1420, 1499)\nthe primary way of educating students is also by this way, with text span (1514, 1571)\nAcademic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better, with text span (1573, 1682) END"}

What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.\nFurthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.\nFinally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.\nTo sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI still hold the environment protection for long-term interest, with text span (2005, 2067)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsupporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, with text span (1920, 2003)\nconservation is more urgent now than at any time in history, with text span (271, 330)\nsupporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually, with text span (1037, 1106)\nconservation leads us to a higher standard of living, with text span (1492, 1544)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nan increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation, with text span (1118, 1183)\nsponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising, with text span (1196, 1261)\nJust imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society, with text span (1263, 1481)\nAccording to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered, with text span (332, 553)\nrising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries, with text span (568, 684)\nIf we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms, with text span (686, 910)\nthe ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will, with text span (922, 1022)\nart is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, with text span (1561, 1617)\nwith exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs, with text span (1624, 1741)\nBiodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art, with text span (1743, 1898) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless\n\nUnemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.\nGovernment money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.\nAlso, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.\nOf course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.\nIn conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out, with text span (189, 291)\ndirect financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity, with text span (1519, 1633)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, with text span (1454, 1517)\nGovernment money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only, with text span (293, 362)\nto survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well, with text span (706, 790)\nthis does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance, with text span (920, 989)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTax revenue is collected from those who works, with text span (364, 409)\nSpending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers, with text span (411, 509)\nthere are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, with text span (520, 625)\naddressing unemployment should have low priority, with text span (630, 678)\nIf they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all, with text span (792, 907)\nit is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again, with text span (1315, 1402)\nThey are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support, with text span (991, 1128)\nthe government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work, with text span (1144, 1302) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDistance-learning cannot bring the benefits that traditional colleges offer\n \nWith the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.\nTo begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.\nBesides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.\nIt is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.\nIn conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents can acquire more benefits from the remote education, with text span (379, 439)\ndistance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose, with text span (1863, 2059)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntraditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future, with text span (1740, 1852)\nstudying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense, with text span (456, 527)\nlong-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches, with text span (862, 998)\ntraditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations, with text span (1346, 1460)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nStudents who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection, with text span (529, 679)\nThis especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line, with text span (681, 846)\nhe can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course, with text span (1237, 1322)\nA student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule, with text span (1137, 1233)\nPupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc, with text span (1000, 1135)\nThese make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities, with text span (1462, 1568)\nwith the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts, with text span (1574, 1708) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLearning to be independent is essential for young adults\n\nLearning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.\nFirst of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.\nFurthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.\nThe third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.\nTo sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstaying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult, with text span (211, 308)\nstaying longer with parents is a better choice, with text span (1924, 1970)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nliving with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents, with text span (1818, 1915)\nundergoing with parents is worthwhile, with text span (879, 916)\nthe parents can save money, if their children live with them longer, with text span (1305, 1372)\ntaking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily, with text span (1730, 1805)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe young adult can have more experience with his parents, with text span (469, 526)\nThe young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age, with text span (528, 611)\nWhen having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown, with text span (613, 682)\nIf he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together, with text span (684, 805)\nAll memories become priceless treasure as time passes by, with text span (807, 863)\nhe may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents, with text span (1064, 1140)\nanother daily expense is also the considerable outgoings, with text span (1152, 1208)\nSpending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be, with text span (1210, 1292)\nliving at home costs less than living outside, with text span (931, 976)\nLearning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home, with text span (978, 1051)\nthe young adult needs father and mother's suggestions, with text span (1410, 1463)\nWhen in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand, with text span (1465, 1533)\nThey are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way, with text span (1535, 1642)\nIf the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain, with text span (1644, 1721) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe best way of learning life\n\nLife is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.\nOn one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.\nOn the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.\nAccording to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?\nIn summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nlearning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate, with text span (2037, 2107)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter, with text span (447, 559)\nfinding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature, with text span (975, 1067)\nexperiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice, with text span (1763, 1845)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nFamily members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life, with text span (561, 693)\nAnd friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not, with text span (695, 857)\nBy listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things, with text span (859, 954)\nthere are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself, with text span (1084, 1173)\na friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous, with text span (1188, 1254)\nIf you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely, with text span (1256, 1338)\nfamily and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time, with text span (1353, 1427)\nYou will grow to be dependent and reliant, with text span (1429, 1470)\nfree yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose, with text span (1485, 1607)\ngrowth is a long process that experience is indispensable, with text span (1689, 1746) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEnvironmental protection vs Economic developments\n\nEnvironmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. \nFirst, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. \nSecond, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.\nSome people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.\nIn conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ntackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments, with text span (365, 460)\nenvironmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence, with text span (2286, 2407)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nenvironmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments, with text span (501, 571)\nthe influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues, with text span (914, 1004)\neconomic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside, with text span (1666, 1739)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwe will all perish as she's gone, with text span (761, 793)\nJust like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well, with text span (795, 903)\nWithout Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain, with text span (657, 752)\nAll the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one, with text span (573, 655)\nEnvironmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems, with text span (1006, 1122)\nTake global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together, with text span (1124, 1255)\nThe melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, with text span (1257, 1463)\nthe rising sea water could drown them, with text span (1471, 1508)\nEnvironmental issues can not be divided by nationality, with text span (1510, 1564)\nall humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth, with text span (1573, 1635)\nif the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away, with text span (1759, 1936)\nthe truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now, with text span (1947, 2084)\nIt would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages, with text span (2086, 2269) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nReading fictions is more pleasant\n\nThere are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.\nFirstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.\nSecondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.\nSome people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.\nTo sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nreading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies, with text span (144, 198)\nreading fictions is more pleasant, with text span (1729, 1762)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthese books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners, with text span (1771, 1861)\nfiction books pay more attention to details, with text span (235, 278)\nreading a novel is more convenient, with text span (740, 774)\npeople enjoy watching TV, with text span (1303, 1327)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwe can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it, with text span (289, 369)\nMost of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening, with text span (371, 490)\nafter I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people, with text span (505, 646)\na movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters, with text span (657, 728)\nSome novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour, with text span (776, 857)\nYet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains, with text span (859, 963)\nI have started to read a novel since last week, with text span (978, 1024)\nI do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class, with text span (1026, 1141)\nI cannot watch a complete movie, with text span (1156, 1187)\nI can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study, with text span (1196, 1272)\nthey can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies, with text span (1343, 1416)\nmovies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners, with text span (1470, 1530)\ncharacters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners, with text span (1537, 1607)\nFor these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable, with text span (1609, 1716) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe government should allocate more funds to public services instead of arts\n\nThe issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.\nFirst of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.\nOn top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society.

Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.\nPressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGun control and increasing violence\n\nSome people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. \nFirst of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. \nIn fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. \nMoreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. \nAll in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEmail and text messaging threats written language\n\nThe introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.\nFirst of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.\nThe popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.\nIn conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthey may be factors decreasing the position of written language, with text span (199, 262)\nwe cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity, with text span (1969, 2091)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity, with text span (397, 535)\nThe popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position, with text span (1238, 1345)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nBefore email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones, with text span (537, 665)\nSuch ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information, with text span (667, 808)\nPeople can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want, with text span (876, 952)\nthanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time, with text span (966, 1128)\nThey are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways, with text span (1130, 1236)\nemail and cell phones have improved the obstacles above, with text span (819, 874)\nPeople tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities, with text span (1347, 1476)\nlanguage in writing is not in its original form, with text span (1498, 1545)\npeople compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts, with text span (1567, 1724)\nit is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments, with text span (1736, 1844)\nIf that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand, with text span (1846, 1952) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling?\n\nIn my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.\nA student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.\nAnother reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.\nIn addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.\nThus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies.

There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid.

The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.\nHowever, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.\nTaking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives.

Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildren can effectively learn from watching television\n\nTV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.\nIt is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.\nBut on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. \nIn conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nby allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth, with text span (179, 281)\nif students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children, with text span (1520, 1670)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nIf children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study, with text span (283, 379)\nBy watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities, with text span (599, 673)\nwatching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health, with text span (942, 1020)\ndemerits of watching TV outweigh its merits, with text span (1467, 1510)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThere are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings, with text span (452, 597)\nCooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs, with text span (688, 921)\nTV is one of the prime source of data and information, with text span (397, 450)\nthey can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain, with text span (1035, 1116)\nSometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences, with text span (1118, 1242)\nMany times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades, with text span (1244, 1439) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUsing animals for the benefit of the human beings\n\nWith the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.\nFirst of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.\nThough animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould animals be free or live in zoos?\n\nMany people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.\nMany scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. \nIn addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwe must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment, with text span (206, 279)\nwe have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible, with text span (1347, 1422)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nScientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals, with text span (1424, 1491)\nmany zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them, with text span (1503, 1564)\nMany scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals, with text span (281, 365)\nvarious zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care, with text span (843, 940)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nlike we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts, with text span (376, 457)\nWhen we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts, with text span (524, 661)\nwhen they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate, with text span (670, 805)\nI was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated, with text span (1003, 1058)\nI can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo, with text span (1060, 1166)\nThey beat them up, with text span (1168, 1185)\nthey did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals, with text span (1194, 1306) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversities require students to study many subjects or specialize in one subject\n\nUniversity is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.\nFirst of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.\nIn addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.\nFinally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nshould one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style?\n\nWith increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.\nThis is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.\nFurthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.\nDespite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.\nWith those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nfashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles, with text span (433, 530)\npeople should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes, with text span (1876, 2032)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ncreative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like, with text span (2053, 2161)\nfollowing fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today, with text span (548, 741)\nWithout following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles, with text span (1358, 1501)\nthe world would look monotonous, with text span (1791, 1822)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWhen individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world, with text span (743, 983)\nif they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds, with text span (998, 1151)\nthey might fall behind shortly, with text span (1166, 1196)\npeople with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information, with text span (1211, 1356)\nfollowing fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities, with text span (1539, 1615)\nIndividuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes, with text span (1617, 1775) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology inspires children's creativity instead of weakening it\n\nTechnology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.\nFirst, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.\nSecond, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.\nAdmittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products.

Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.\nIn addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology.

Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.\nThe last thing is about education.

These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYoung adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out\n\nAs young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.\nLiving on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.\nAnother advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.\nWhile some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time\n\nNowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.\nFirstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.\nIn addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.\nFinally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.\nIn conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ncars have improved modern life, with text span (319, 349)\nTravelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car, with text span (2335, 2500)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ncars cause a lot of pollution, with text span (2223, 2252)\nMany people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances, with text span (521, 592)\ncars increase the chance of employment, with text span (1086, 1124)\npeople who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world, with text span (2060, 2150)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life, with text span (2261, 2333)\nthey can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle, with text span (601, 659)\nmy car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city, with text span (703, 810)\nI was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away, with text span (812, 892)\nThanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today, with text span (894, 985)\nWithout my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship, with text span (987, 1071)\npeople are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages, with text span (381, 489)\npeople are able to drive to work and can work further away from home, with text span (1133, 1201)\nthey are more flexible, with text span (1216, 1238)\nMy father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money, with text span (1240, 1342)\nHe used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend, with text span (1344, 1460)\nIf he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms, with text span (1462, 1627)\nthe automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world, with text span (1638, 1718)\nIf people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life, with text span (1720, 1817)\nThey are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas, with text span (1819, 1905)\nThere are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car, with text span (1907, 2045) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSpending equal amount of money on libraries and sports?\n\nUniversity students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.\nFirst, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football\/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.\nIn addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.\nFinally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. \nIn conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nboth sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories, with text span (2219, 2325)\nI don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities, with text span (374, 515)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nI do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, with text span (2123, 2205)\nspending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football\/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports, with text span (535, 684)\nThe university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students, with text span (1300, 1387)\nspending money on social activities looks like wasting money, with text span (1719, 1779)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmy roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory, with text span (699, 820)\nWhen she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day, with text span (822, 937)\nshe is doing exercise without spending a cent, with text span (951, 996)\nWhat the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health, with text span (998, 1231)\nstudents choose their major based on their interests, with text span (1246, 1298)\ntheir major in completely involved in physical activities, with text span (1397, 1454)\nfor an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, with text span (1469, 1579)\nit really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field, with text span (1589, 1708)\nFor students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose, with text span (1781, 1926)\nwhen I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people, with text span (1940, 2105) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums\n\nHow to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.\nTaking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.\nEntertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.\nFurthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.\nTo summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernment should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities, with text span (213, 321)\nbudgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, with text span (1916, 2026)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens, with text span (2036, 2147)\nproviding education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government, with text span (758, 846)\nEntertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented, with text span (848, 944)\nsectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, with text span (1723, 1799)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTaking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums, with text span (398, 543)\nan uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games, with text span (566, 745)\nTheir existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience, with text span (946, 1058)\nThe competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government, with text span (1060, 1193)\nthe establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government, with text span (1204, 1393)\nit is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs, with text span (1593, 1698)\nthey are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis, with text span (1809, 1878)\nputting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them, with text span (1408, 1511)\nnot everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot, with text span (1526, 1580) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGetting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance.\n\nGetting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.\nTo begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.\nAdditionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.\nFinally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.\nIn conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents should be asked to evaluate their teachers, with text span (423, 474)\nschool should ask students to evaluate their teachers, with text span (2085, 2138)\nthere are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers, with text span (2365, 2426)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nteachers could improve their performance, with text span (2147, 2187)\nschools are also improve their quality, with text span (2199, 2237)\nevaluating from students could improve teachers' performance, with text span (976, 1036)\nthis evaluation from students could improve schools' quality, with text span (1052, 1112)\npeople who get the most advantage from evaluation is students, with text span (1563, 1624)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey have high performance teachers, with text span (2246, 2281)\nstudents are easy to understand their subjects, with text span (2296, 2342)\nEvaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance, with text span (491, 563)\nevaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product, with text span (578, 710)\nStudents might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information, with text span (712, 819)\nteachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give, with text span (835, 963)\nschool have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students, with text span (1462, 1552)\nin many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products, with text span (1272, 1348)\nthey have employees whose performance are very high, with text span (1357, 1408)\nSchools could produce intellectual students, with text span (1410, 1453)\nTeachers could augment their quality, with text span (1114, 1150)\nWhen school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality, with text span (1166, 1256)\nteachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, with text span (1729, 1833)\nstudents could comprehend their subject easily, with text span (1835, 1881)\nstudents, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life, with text span (1896, 2035)\nStudents could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance, with text span (1626, 1719) END"}

People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.\nIt is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe ability to relate well to people is more important\n\nI think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:\nWe need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.\nOne of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOld and young workers\n\nThroughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.\nFirst and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.\nSecondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIs it necessary for children or not?\n\nLearning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. \nFirst, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.\nIn addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World.

Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.\nThe use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.\nThe use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.\nThe use of public transportation make us live more sociable.

This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.\nOn the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.\nWe cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGiving mobile phones to the unemployed\n\nToday, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.\nIn a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.\nNonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.\nFurthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.\nTo put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngiving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money, with text span (444, 515)\nproviding those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment, with text span (2307, 2460)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nif the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive, with text span (1081, 1227)\nthe money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed, with text span (1662, 1753)\nwhen hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity, with text span (1768, 1861)\ntill now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment, with text span (2146, 2262)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities, with text span (546, 684)\nthey can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them, with text span (699, 787)\nWith the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job, with text span (789, 947)\nthe mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with, with text span (964, 1069)\nsupplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money, with text span (1276, 1350)\nthe money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country, with text span (1368, 1485)\nthe money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living, with text span (1515, 1647)\nIt will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless, with text span (1863, 1957)\nSome might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones, with text span (1959, 2070)\nthe public's money is spent worthlessly, with text span (2089, 2128) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWorking Extended hours should restricted\n\nWorking longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, \"Health is Wealth\". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. \nFirst of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.\nSecondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.\nTo conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours, with text span (521, 634)\nI would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies, with text span (1847, 2073)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npeople working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life, with text span (398, 504)\nThis will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person, with text span (2075, 2207)\npeople; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health, with text span (691, 773)\nthese workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign, with text span (1235, 1357)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nBy working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick, with text span (775, 949)\nthey become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons, with text span (961, 1042)\nThe repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life, with text span (1044, 1223)\nthey usually remain busy in their office, with text span (1362, 1402)\nthey do not find leisure time for such social activities, with text span (1406, 1462)\nI would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years, with text span (1478, 1573)\nRecently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries, with text span (1575, 1723)\nHe started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him, with text span (1725, 1827) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversity education is needed for success\n\nIn today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.\nFirst and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.\nLooking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.\nIn addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.\nTo wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\none can also shine without even having to attend universities, with text span (397, 458)\nit would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions, with text span (2177, 2295)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper, with text span (2065, 2166)\nit is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer, with text span (480, 613)\nthere are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university, with text span (1016, 1129)\nindividuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful, with text span (1974, 2044)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWithout proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers, with text span (615, 724)\nNot only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners, with text span (726, 886)\nThis can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals, with text span (888, 980)\nTake for instance those who start their own business, with text span (1131, 1183)\nThese people depend solely on hard work and luck, with text span (1185, 1233)\nfor some of them it proved to be a profitable job, with text span (1250, 1299)\nMichael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19, with text span (1321, 1391)\nhe started his computer company in his college dorm room, with text span (1404, 1460)\nhe used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now, with text span (1474, 1564)\npeople with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life, with text span (1579, 1650)\nThis is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports, with text span (1652, 1716)\nThe introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph, with text span (1718, 1830)\nDavid Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many, with text span (1860, 1946) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSuccess and knowledge\n\nMany people think that \"Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors\". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. \nFirst of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.\nSecondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement \"Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration\" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. \nLast but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLeisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors.\n\nPeople often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.\nThere are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. \nOutdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. \nMoreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.\nAdmittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTelevision is the culprit for destroying communication between friends & family\n\nIt is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.\nIn spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.\nSecond, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.\nLast but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.\nTo sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversity students should attend classes or not?\n\nIn university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. \nFirst, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. \nSecond, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.\nSome people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. \nIn conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is, with text span (518, 595)\nstudents can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes, with text span (2014, 2131)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nin terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams, with text span (605, 705)\nIt's an essential learning process, with text span (2133, 2167)\nclass attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances, with text span (1221, 1291)\nif students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own, with text span (1416, 1539)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nClasses are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students, with text span (707, 819)\nProfessors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements, with text span (821, 964)\nThose who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes, with text span (1293, 1385)\nMany professors grade their students with class attendances, with text span (1144, 1203)\nAttending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves, with text span (1028, 1142)\nit's students' basic responsibility to attend class, with text span (975, 1026)\nthis is a rather immodest way of thinking, with text span (1635, 1676)\nprofessors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors, with text span (1693, 1830)\neven if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates, with text span (1841, 1996) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTesting on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions\n\nPerhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.\nThere are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.\nSecondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.\nThere is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nprimates should have the same rights as human beings, with text span (339, 391)\nit should be made illegal, with text span (1708, 1733)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result, with text span (1631, 1689)\nThere are several reasons why animal testing should be banned, with text span (393, 454)\nsacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity, with text span (1150, 1206)\nhuman beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual, with text span (1506, 1596)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe costs outweigh the benefits, with text span (465, 496)\nEvery year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result, with text span (498, 633)\nAnimal testing costs an enormous amount of money, with text span (635, 683)\nthey must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances, with text span (691, 768)\nanimals are kept in unnatural conditions, with text span (780, 820)\nRecent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs, with text span (822, 935)\nIn March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head, with text span (937, 1121)\nanimals and people's response to a drug can be different, with text span (1422, 1478)\nit is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, with text span (1335, 1414) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFinancial aid to develop countries\n\nAs is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.\nFirstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.\nIn addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.\nIn conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nfinancial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries, with text span (1598, 1656)\nit is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries, with text span (281, 366)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation, with text span (1662, 1839)\nif the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support, with text span (775, 971)\ndeveloping countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries, with text span (1486, 1581)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid, with text span (979, 1121)\neducation is an essential part in development, with text span (492, 537)\nmost developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities, with text span (553, 735)\nsome powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market, with text span (1213, 1358)\nthey rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas, with text span (1368, 1473) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues\n\nIn today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.\nThe second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society.

For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.\nIn conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions, with text span (274, 387)\na greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being, with text span (1619, 1812)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsociety should be educated and became aware of health issues, with text span (736, 796)\ngovernments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society, with text span (968, 1095)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ndecreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients, with text span (541, 723)\nthe potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients, with text span (805, 944)\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system, with text span (389, 524)\nthere is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health, with text span (1112, 1220)\na government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives, with text span (1233, 1388)\nthe marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign, with text span (1403, 1602) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nType of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone\n\nStudy achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.\nTo begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people.

Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome young adults want independence from their parents quickly\n\nMany young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. \nLiving in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.\nAnother problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.\nIn conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nVegetarianism - why some people are choosing to become vegetarian?\n\nSince the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.\nFirstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.\nSecondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.\nTo sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect, with text span (459, 540)\npeople choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals, with text span (1446, 1550)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nhealth improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular, with text span (551, 629)\nit is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind, with text span (1314, 1407)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nMany researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer, with text span (631, 736)\na vegetable diet can do good for our health, with text span (767, 810)\na meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, with text span (837, 893)\nit is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources, with text span (895, 991)\neating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings, with text span (1156, 1227)\nSome religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, with text span (1059, 1151) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLiving and studying overseas\n\nIt is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.\nFirst, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself\/herself into new environments and situations in life.\nSecond, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.\nAlso, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his\/her peers.\nIn conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOne or two close friends vs. a large number of casual acquaintances\n\nThere is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.\nWe can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.\nSecond, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. \nTo me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances, with text span (207, 303)\nfriends are the most important people in my life second to my family, with text span (1701, 1769)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends, with text span (814, 893)\nclose friends can easily understand each others feelings, with text span (903, 959)\na friend is a person you care about, with text span (1656, 1691)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nbeing a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant, with text span (326, 394)\nit's not easy to make friend with anyone, with text span (403, 443)\nfriends are people who have great compatibility with each other, with text span (455, 518)\nAfter two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways, with text span (520, 707)\nSometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances, with text span (709, 755)\nWe spend time together but we could never be friend, with text span (757, 808)\nacquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends, with text span (1004, 1078)\nthey wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings, with text span (1090, 1145)\nEveryone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time, with text span (1147, 1213)\nBeing friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend, with text span (1215, 1299)\nWhen my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible, with text span (1301, 1436)\nIf my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business, with text span (1438, 1591)\nmy friend will do the same to me, with text span (1607, 1639) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOveremphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media\n\nAs a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:\nIt is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.\nFirst of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.\nFurthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.\nBased on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nmedia is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society, with text span (123, 206)\ndisadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages, with text span (229, 329)\npaying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem, with text span (1601, 1686)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmedia provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people, with text span (389, 499)\nsensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems, with text span (1109, 1175)\ngossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion, with text span (790, 894)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThe most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip, with text span (501, 591)\njournalism is changing, with text span (602, 624)\nSome reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people, with text span (626, 774)\nthese personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society, with text span (1291, 1425)\nyellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues, with text span (1443, 1550)\nThe media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience, with text span (1177, 1283)\nThe audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story, with text span (896, 984)\nit is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported, with text span (996, 1094) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy\n\nThe increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.\nFirstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.\nSecondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.\nTo conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy, with text span (1340, 1425)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThis can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming, with text span (1427, 1525)\nit would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources, with text span (834, 935)\nthe sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming, with text span (947, 1089)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe major source of energy today is water, with text span (346, 387)\nthere is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source, with text span (398, 500)\nTo generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short, with text span (502, 576)\nduring summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India, with text span (584, 672)\nIf the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity, with text span (674, 821)\nthe use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming, with text span (1104, 1201)\nthe use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution, with text span (1220, 1325) END"}

However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. \nAdmittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. \nComputers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth\n\nIn today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.\nThe first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. \nThe second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould people be forced to stop working?\n\nThe appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.\nFirst and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.\nApart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.\nAdmittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.\nIn conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old, with text span (299, 365)\nstrongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age, with text span (379, 478)\nit is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement, with text span (2370, 2434)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmost of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for, with text span (674, 773)\nit would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones, with text span (1803, 1892)\nthe expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated, with text span (1906, 1988)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nif senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates, with text span (550, 659)\na medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available, with text span (803, 1060)\ndue to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace, with text span (1078, 1247)\nnot all elderly workers are physically well, with text span (1266, 1309)\nBeyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses, with text span (1311, 1485)\nthe stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him, with text span (1507, 1594)\nthey will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing, with text span (1610, 1677)\nthe academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution, with text span (1688, 1795)\nTheir invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation, with text span (1990, 2152)\nit is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge, with text span (2161, 2353) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nProtect animals or not?\n \nMany animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.\nAnimal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.\nHowever, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.\nFurthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.\nIn conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwe should give priority to our own issues, with text span (260, 301)\nmore emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction, with text span (1524, 1669)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible, with text span (605, 678)\nspecies extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution, with text span (697, 769)\nWe should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species, with text span (1393, 1507)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nbiodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem, with text span (368, 430)\nIf certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat, with text span (432, 592)\nThe environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being, with text span (771, 871)\nA great number of plants and animals died out, with text span (873, 918)\nthey were unable to fit into the new environment, with text span (927, 975)\nthe process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it, with text span (996, 1083)\nhuman beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars, with text span (1098, 1198)\nWhen these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help, with text span (1200, 1391) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAttending university classes should be required or optional\n\nAttending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.\nFirstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.\nSecondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. \nIn conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngoing to classes should be optional for students, with text span (286, 334)\nattending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore, with text span (1704, 1784)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room, with text span (448, 547)\nthey can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well, with text span (1018, 1145)\nthe students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time, with text span (1496, 1612)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nStudent can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand, with text span (549, 651)\nI have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university, with text span (666, 744)\nShe learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast, with text span (746, 808)\nshe rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic, with text span (816, 890)\nshe got very good grade when she was graduation, with text span (901, 948)\nmany times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes, with text span (1165, 1276)\nI had already studied all biology topics before attending university, with text span (1284, 1352)\nI spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry, with text span (1367, 1470) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLiving in smal towns\n\nPlace of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.\nFirstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.\nSecondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.\nIn conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA successful person is one who has earned a lot of money\n\nIt's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.\nMoney is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.\nMore importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.\nIn conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity\n\nThe city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. \nHistoric buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. \nFurthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. \nMeanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. \nOverall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA more convenient life in a city\n\nThere are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.\nOn the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.\nOn the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.\nFurthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. \nThere is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. \nIn conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI prefer to live in a big city, with text span (295, 325)\nif I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in, with text span (2131, 2349)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nI have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area, with text span (364, 455)\nlife in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town, with text span (669, 726)\nliving in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information, with text span (1046, 1132)\nThere is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring, with text span (1646, 1779)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nI will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace, with text span (480, 558)\nI can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city, with text span (572, 648)\nYou can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities, with text span (728, 801)\nyou can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising, with text span (817, 956)\na small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs, with text span (962, 1032)\nIf one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals, with text span (1134, 1258)\nthere are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones, with text span (1273, 1413)\nIf one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice, with text span (1415, 1643)\nSchools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers, with text span (1781, 1980)\nOur children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development, with text span (1982, 2113) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMost difficult experiences will become valuable lessons\n\nThere is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.\nTo start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.\nWhat's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.\nSo, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nNowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past\n\nThe modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.\nTo start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the \"weaker\" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.\nIn the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.\nAdmittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.\nAll things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nThis, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society, with text span (242, 311)\nin a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles, with text span (1755, 1900)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nWomen nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on, with text span (544, 680)\nthe revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well, with text span (925, 1032)\nsuch changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate, with text span (1340, 1422)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe \"weaker\" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields, with text span (698, 902)\nGone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children, with text span (432, 542)\nthe fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society, with text span (350, 430)\nThe financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money, with text span (1034, 1168)\nwomen have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration, with text span (1184, 1326)\nwomen find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives, with text span (1453, 1538)\nchildren might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work, with text span (1546, 1627) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudents should be required to take regular standardized tests\n\nThe issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.\nFirstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.\nAdditionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.\nFinally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don't because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.\nUltimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstandardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge, with text span (255, 403)\nschools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right, with text span (1822, 1896)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthese schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students, with text span (1934, 2033)\nstandardized tests are preferable, with text span (414, 447)\nschools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides, with text span (1197, 1299)\nrequirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, with text span (1323, 1381)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nexams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students, with text span (637, 721)\nsome students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue, with text span (530, 624)\nmany teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, with text span (736, 803)\nthe usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them, with text span (808, 871)\nsome students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, with text span (983, 1065)\nthey will never try to solve problems on their own, with text span (1070, 1120)\nstandardized tests offer them such chance, with text span (1131, 1172)\nstandardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice, with text span (887, 974)\nin this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students, with text span (1389, 1467)\nIn any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively, with text span (1469, 1594)\nstandardized tests are required over those who don't, with text span (1639, 1691)\nif the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them, with text span (1700, 1797)\nthey help teachers to fairly grade the students, with text span (469, 516) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAir pollution\n\nAir pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. \nFirst, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.\nSecond, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. \nOn the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. \nIn conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nmore responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution, with text span (192, 302)\nboth companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution, with text span (1848, 1942)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ngovernments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, with text span (1698, 1846)\nIf these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause, with text span (703, 856)\nby charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution, with text span (1222, 1348)\ngovernments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies, with text span (1385, 1492)\nGovernments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals, with text span (1494, 1659)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nin most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions, with text span (312, 426)\nThe waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution, with text span (428, 536)\nWhile these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution, with text span (538, 701)\nprivate individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating, with text span (866, 971)\nAs house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes, with text span (973, 1130)\nsome expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution, with text span (1149, 1205) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nParents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life\n\nNowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.\nFirst of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.\nSecondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCan technology alone solve the world's environmental problems?\n\nIt is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.\nSome people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.\nOn the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.\nThere are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.\nTo put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ntechnology alone can solve the world's environmental problems, with text span (1955, 2016)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nif humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment, with text span (459, 558)\ntechnology alone could save the environment, with text span (930, 973)\nThere are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot, with text span (1147, 1234)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is the luxuries people use which damages the environment, with text span (576, 635)\nIf people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment, with text span (637, 880)\nnow we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back, with text span (991, 1062)\nWe cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart, with text span (1064, 1145)\nOne prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa, with text span (1236, 1331)\nBy pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource, with text span (1333, 1509)\nJapan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030, with text span (1524, 1592)\nBy drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions, with text span (1594, 1743)\nIf successful, the impact on the world would be monumental, with text span (1745, 1803)\nIt would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes, with text span (1805, 1859)\nIt would mean another industrial revolution, with text span (1861, 1904) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nBenefits of students doing extra jobs\n\nIn present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.\nIt is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.\nSecondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.\nLastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.\nIn conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nhaving a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits, with text span (1977, 2064)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nBy taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation, with text span (2066, 2210)\nhaving experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation, with text span (856, 993)\nstudents who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones, with text span (1005, 1098)\ndoing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation, with text span (1505, 1570)\nthat helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life, with text span (1811, 1940)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIt is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs, with text span (394, 500)\nstudents who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience, with text span (751, 844)\nthat seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities, with text span (622, 736)\nPart-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities, with text span (502, 607)\nBy constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained, with text span (1100, 1290)\nworking conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities, with text span (1298, 1495)\nhigh studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students, with text span (1580, 1683)\nWith the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved, with text span (1685, 1799) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFriendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible\n\nThere is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. \nFirst of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. \nSecond, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nJury must have access to criminals' past records\n\nCourts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.\nMany people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.\nNevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.\nIn conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCapital punishment; 51% countries have polished death penalty\n\n\"Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime.\" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.\nFirstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.\nSecondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.\nFinally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. \nTo conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould students be taught to compete or to cooperate?\n\nIt is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.\nFirst of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.\nOn the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.\nConsequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwe should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education, with text span (503, 575)\na more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success, with text span (2154, 2231)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthrough cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students, with text span (591, 714)\ncompetition makes the society more effective, with text span (1332, 1376)\nwithout the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition, with text span (1927, 1992)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWhat we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others, with text span (716, 851)\nDuring the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred, with text span (853, 1086)\nAll of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life, with text span (1088, 1191)\nthe significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory, with text span (1212, 1301)\nwhen we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation, with text span (1387, 1492)\nTake Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care, with text span (1549, 1846) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFollow the New Customs of the New Country or Not?\n\nWhen people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.\nOn one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.\nOn the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.\nAll in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country, with text span (386, 450)\nthe immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, with text span (2138, 2197)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs, with text span (465, 558)\nkeeping own customs stably might cause discrimination, with text span (1132, 1185)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWhen people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures, with text span (560, 689)\nThe custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture, with text span (691, 802)\nif one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture, with text span (817, 1027)\npeople understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country, with text span (1042, 1111)\nWhen people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country, with text span (1187, 1326)\nThe local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society, with text span (1328, 1439)\nOne example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969, with text span (1441, 1512)\nThey formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it, with text span (1514, 1579)\nWhile the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working, with text span (1581, 1691)\nbeing much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination, with text span (1702, 1768)\nTheir houses and private cars were buried by local people, with text span (1770, 1827)\nthe locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs, with text span (1837, 1933)\nIf the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated, with text span (1935, 2124) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternet will end the era of newspapers and magazines\n\nDigital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.\nA very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.\nPeople often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction\n\nSome people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.\nIt is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. \nNevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. \nIn summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nother celebrities do lead young people in the right direction, with text span (1900, 1961)\nthis is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs, with text span (255, 341)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsome celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, with text span (1812, 1898)\nthe attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status, with text span (775, 864)\nother celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments, with text span (953, 1049)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nsome celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public, with text span (359, 428)\nsome movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention, with text span (443, 594)\nIf they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work, with text span (596, 759)\ncelebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans, with text span (1060, 1170)\npeople understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results, with text span (1188, 1284)\nthis kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance, with text span (1297, 1412)\nother celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career, with text span (1424, 1507)\nTake Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation, with text span (1509, 1649)\nHis songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society, with text span (1651, 1788) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA university plans to devlope a new research centre in your country\n\nMost of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.\nFirst of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.\nSecondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.\nAnother reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. \nSome people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nComputers - use, future prospects and over-dependence\n\nComputer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as \"Father of computers\") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.\nIn the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.\nMoreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.\nHowever, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.\nNevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ndependence on computers is not a bad thing, with text span (2059, 2101)\nThe whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years, with text span (244, 342)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ncomputers have provided security and sophistication, with text span (1996, 2047)\nComputers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it, with text span (801, 945)\nfuture prospects of computers are very bright, with text span (957, 1002)\nComputers have made humans over-dependent, with text span (1344, 1385)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIn the modern world, computers are used everywhere, with text span (344, 394)\nRight from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed, with text span (396, 470)\nThey are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on, with text span (472, 539)\nComputers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast, with text span (541, 612)\nin earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months, with text span (627, 724)\ntoday, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks, with text span (730, 799)\nFrom a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm, with text span (1004, 1085)\nNanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels, with text span (1087, 1165)\nResearch on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on, with text span (1167, 1256)\nThere is no end to the evolution of computers, with text span (1258, 1303)\nVirus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list, with text span (1387, 1541)\nComputers expose children to vulgar materials, with text span (1543, 1588)\nThey have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook), with text span (1590, 1738)\nComputers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives, with text span (1740, 1847)\nThe recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful, with text span (1849, 1947) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSerious or entertaining movies\n\nI prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. \nFirst, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.\nSecond, not all of serious movies are boring. \"Click\" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.\nMoreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. \"Blood diamond\", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nZoos have no useful purpose?\n\nHave you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.\nWhen people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. \nAnimals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. \nFinally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.\nThe reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nzoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding, with text span (365, 471)\nzoos are very useful, with text span (2755, 2775)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nin some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities, with text span (2479, 2585)\nThe zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents, with text span (876, 1037)\nVisiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school, with text span (1808, 1885)\na visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals, with text span (1897, 1983)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThis is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos, with text span (2587, 2649)\nWhen people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity, with text span (473, 592)\nIn the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs, with text span (594, 780)\nNowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago, with text span (782, 874)\nAnimals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities, with text span (1040, 1151)\nWe can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience, with text span (1153, 1278)\nIf you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have, with text span (1280, 1441)\nIn the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult, with text span (1443, 1557)\nIt offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies, with text span (1559, 1735)\nit will also help identify which animals could be dangerous, with text span (1747, 1806)\nBeing able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve, with text span (2263, 2427)\nIt is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it, with text span (1985, 2071)\nThis is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs, with text span (2073, 2206)\nIn the present there is a lack of respect for animals, with text span (2208, 2261) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment should spend money on ARTs, not only on public services\n\nAs people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.\nAdmittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.\nOn the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.\nFrom the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.\nWith those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\narts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well, with text span (380, 451)\npublic services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure, with text span (2004, 2085)\nthe authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous, with text span (2105, 2207)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npublic services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability, with text span (943, 1056)\narts should by no means been disregarded by the government, with text span (1087, 1145)\nfunding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development, with text span (1545, 1618)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe government should give priority to public services and facilities, with text span (465, 534)\nthe government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable, with text span (552, 722)\npublic services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate, with text span (740, 930)\narts can enrich people's cultural lives, with text span (1161, 1200)\nCurrently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition, with text span (1202, 1302)\nthey require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure, with text span (1318, 1429)\nWithout arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems, with text span (1431, 1504)\nCultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts, with text span (1620, 1675)\npreserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry, with text span (1688, 1893)\narts serve cultural and economic purposes, with text span (1909, 1950) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome people prefer to work for a large company\n\nCompanies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.\nFirst, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.\nSecond, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.\nThird, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.\nIn conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI personally prefer to work for a large company, with text span (321, 368)\nI would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one, with text span (1596, 1664)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nI have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences, with text span (1666, 1862)\nto find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company, with text span (397, 486)\na large company can give better salaries than a smaller one, with text span (862, 921)\nlarge companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people, with text span (1283, 1487)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nLarge company equals more job opportunity, with text span (798, 839)\nLarge companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries, with text span (488, 639)\nif a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there, with text span (654, 780)\nThe fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success, with text span (923, 1013)\nthis means that the company can give more salaries to its employees, with text span (1031, 1098)\ncommon sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company, with text span (1114, 1238)\nAs well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops, with text span (1489, 1552) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSmoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places\n\nSmoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.\nFirst of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he\/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.\nFurthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. \nLastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. \nTo conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it, with text span (2516, 2652)\nsmoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it, with text span (247, 371)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsmoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior, with text span (2370, 2434)\nsmoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health, with text span (380, 488)\nsmoking in restaurants should be strictly banned, with text span (1154, 1202)\nthe disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience, with text span (1403, 1537)\nsmoking does no good to the smoker himself, with text span (1853, 1895)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIt spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health, with text span (2436, 2503)\nthe second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself, with text span (730, 872)\nit makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health, with text span (1211, 1291)\nif there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked, with text span (887, 1010)\nsome burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he\/she inhales it, with text span (1028, 1141)\nit is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health, with text span (513, 697)\nThe smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals, with text span (1539, 1678)\nThis, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity, with text span (1680, 1756)\nfewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences, with text span (1765, 1842)\nNot only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation, with text span (1897, 2036)\nmost people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior, with text span (2149, 2217)\nThis is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, with text span (2038, 2139)\nthe public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader, with text span (2234, 2354) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMobile phone; \"Iron man\" \/ \"Weichat\" - destroy social interactions?\n\nRecently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.\nIn the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.\nFurthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as \"Iron man\". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.\nHowever, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as \"Weichat\", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.\nAfter having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthis great invention causes many social problems, with text span (392, 440)\nthey also contribute to some social problems, with text span (1942, 1986)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nspending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life, with text span (462, 535)\nthe hardship of communication may be developed, with text span (1284, 1330)\nmobile phones have shortened the distance of communicatio, with text span (1714, 1771)\nmobile phones brings convenience of communication, with text span (1891, 1940)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nas people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends, with text span (557, 695)\ndistraction may be developed during study or social activities, with text span (704, 766)\ncontinuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children, with text span (778, 870)\nmany games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours, with text span (1128, 1271)\nIn those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again, with text span (1005, 1112)\nthere are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as \"Iron man\", with text span (885, 1003)\nas lots of chatting apps available online such as \"Weichat\", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication, with text span (1528, 1701)\nWith rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet, with text span (1404, 1512) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTelevision versus Friends and family\n\nWe all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.\nFirst of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.\nSecondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.\nLast but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?\nIn conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us, with text span (264, 352)\nit has destroyed communication among friends and family, with text span (1640, 1695)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntelevision has some good sides, with text span (1608, 1638)\nthey can be isolated from others, with text span (408, 440)\nchildren will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents, with text span (978, 1054)\ncommunication between family members is visibly destroyed, with text span (1168, 1225)\nwatching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human, with text span (1247, 1350)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\npeople watch television too much, with text span (374, 406)\nChildren, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others, with text span (442, 654)\nGradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying, with text span (656, 728)\nwith the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common, with text span (740, 847)\nParents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room, with text span (849, 958)\nparents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children, with text span (1066, 1153)\nwatching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing, with text span (1365, 1455) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPrevention is better than cure\n\nThere has always been a saying in medicine: \"Prevention is better than cure\". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.\nNo one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.\nIn addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.\nTo sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthis plan should be put into practice, with text span (302, 339)\nI have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures, with text span (1332, 1441)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThis will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance, with text span (1443, 1555)\nNo one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness, with text span (383, 533)\nit will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases, with text span (873, 941)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nChildren should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, with text span (535, 622)\nthey will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle, with text span (632, 701)\nit is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants, with text span (717, 858)\nsuch unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years, with text span (960, 1102)\nif humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance, with text span (1115, 1319) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould the cost of medicines be reduced?\n\nAt present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.\nAdmittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.\nHowever, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.\nFortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.\nIn conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities, with text span (1719, 1803)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThe reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity, with text span (727, 798)\nthere are other measures to improve the situation, with text span (1381, 1430)\nthe current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness, with text span (809, 905)\nthe measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation, with text span (1241, 1322)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIf people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better, with text span (630, 725)\nmore lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines, with text span (327, 385)\nThe medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs, with text span (387, 476)\nWith advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses, with text span (478, 628)\nIt is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes, with text span (1432, 1570)\ncharitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free, with text span (1586, 1702)\nthe process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money, with text span (919, 1020)\nthese products prove to ensure human health completely, with text span (1032, 1086)\nSuppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure, with text span (1088, 1228) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUse of CCTV cameras\n\nToday, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.\nFirstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.\nFurthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.\nLooking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.\nTo conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nCCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace, with text span (504, 638)\nCCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise, with text span (2404, 2479)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThis is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers, with text span (2481, 2560)\nCCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized, with text span (1229, 1300)\nthese cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers, with text span (1805, 1899)\nThose opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras, with text span (1983, 2096)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nprivacies are lost with the use of these cameras, with text span (2574, 2622)\nsafety should be put first in order to be safe, with text span (2637, 2683)\nby having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down, with text span (649, 728)\nwhen a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced, with text span (746, 877)\nin Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight, with text span (907, 1080)\nas the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops, with text span (1097, 1204)\nthe installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation, with text span (1511, 1588)\nthe customers know very well that their conversations are recorded, with text span (1597, 1663)\nat some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers, with text span (1315, 1400)\nface-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger, with text span (1412, 1502)\none must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences, with text span (2107, 2251)\nopponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime, with text span (2259, 2389)\nthe videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken, with text span (1694, 1793) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nImproved medical care\n\nAlong with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.\nThe main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.\nIn addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.\nOn the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSalary is the most important consideration when choosing a job\n\nAlong with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.\nOn one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.\nOn the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthere are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job, with text span (234, 337)\npassion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on, with text span (1781, 1908)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nincome is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers, with text span (1694, 1766)\npeople tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication, with text span (538, 736)\nif we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field, with text span (1048, 1149)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\npeople who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably, with text span (757, 885)\nthey are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths, with text span (903, 1012)\nmoney is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs, with text span (458, 517)\nThere are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters, with text span (1151, 1308)\nimportant factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated, with text span (1319, 1523)\nsome people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies, with text span (1534, 1655) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nE-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face\n\nTechnology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.\nEveryone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.\nIn addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.\nLast but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. \nOn the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating, with text span (270, 363)\ne-mail is the greatest way for major people to use, with text span (1997, 2047)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ne-mail has been a great way of communication, with text span (386, 430)\nwriting e-mail helps people express honestly, with text span (816, 860)\nE-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive, with text span (1855, 1919)\nIts convenience saves our time, with text span (2049, 2079)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nYou can talk to others from thousands mile, with text span (432, 474)\nif you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact, with text span (490, 610)\nWe will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address, with text span (612, 686)\nIf the address is wrong, then you will know right away, with text span (688, 742)\ne-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click, with text span (754, 801)\ne-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out, with text span (1165, 1212)\nthe face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid, with text span (885, 937)\nSometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect, with text span (939, 1005)\nI want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do, with text span (1021, 1152)\nShe will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed, with text span (1214, 1302)\nI don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive, with text span (1304, 1387)\nevery communication needs fluency, with text span (1409, 1442)\npeople can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time, with text span (1446, 1518)\nVoice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident, with text span (1520, 1615)\nwhen I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively, with text span (1630, 1708)\nThey may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say, with text span (1710, 1798)\nAnyone can meet this problem once in any conversation, with text span (1800, 1853) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTelevision and Movies influence our lives both negatively and positively\n\nThere is no doubt that television or movies influence people's behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. \nThere are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people's health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.\nTelevision and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.\nTelevision and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don't prefer it.\nI think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people's behavior in bad ways.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology helps student learn more information and learn more quickly?\n\nNowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.\nTo start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.\nAnother point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.\nOn balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPaying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.\nA raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.\nNevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.\nTo sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees, with text span (1562, 1648)\nproviding a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity, with text span (1665, 1769)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses, with text span (1776, 1856)\nA raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places, with text span (346, 423)\ncreating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances, with text span (1055, 1203)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWorkers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile, with text span (425, 533)\njunior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work, with text span (549, 704)\nit is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want, with text span (726, 812)\nIf the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan, with text span (814, 1024)\nTake Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce, with text span (1205, 1361)\nthe employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured, with text span (1378, 1534) END"}

From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.\nTo begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.\nFurther, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.\nHowever, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. \nBy way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthis development was a very positive one, with text span (329, 369)\nthe development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable, with text span (1540, 1678)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nTechnology revolutionized the way we communicate, with text span (505, 553)\nInternet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends, with text span (1121, 1192)\nthe rate of divorces is increasing day by day, with text span (1432, 1477)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete, with text span (570, 628)\nnowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever, with text span (417, 503)\nBy means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want, with text span (630, 736)\nin earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, with text span (751, 807)\nthey could easily get lost, with text span (817, 843)\nThis is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive, with text span (845, 930)\nby means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends, with text span (941, 1022)\nAccording to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet, with text span (1024, 1104)\nduring such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense, with text span (1335, 1417)\nby communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, with text span (1239, 1325) END"}

This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. \nFirst of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.\nSecondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.\nThus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nfollowing celebrities can be dangerous for the youth, with text span (226, 278)\nwhen young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way, with text span (1524, 1623)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThis has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual, with text span (1625, 1694)\nfollowing celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents, with text span (443, 506)\nthese glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people, with text span (1407, 1484)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nMany young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age, with text span (508, 587)\nin a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes, with text span (602, 833)\nimitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals, with text span (868, 945)\nAdolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior, with text span (1061, 1159)\nrecently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools, with text span (1174, 1366)\nwhen youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way, with text span (977, 1059) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOne important thing that I want to change about my hometown\n\nPublic utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one's needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I'm facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. \nAt first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. \nSecondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.\nLastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.\nTo sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people's living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people's living, with text span (1915, 1999)\nthe thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation, with text span (370, 446)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nI'm facing the traffic congestion every day, with text span (454, 497)\nthis improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly, with text span (1106, 1173)\nit should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train, with text span (546, 646)\nThey should increase more routes to make people transport more easily, with text span (1507, 1576)\nThe necessary energy will slowly be used up, with text span (1821, 1864)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\npeople will have more ways to go to a place, with text span (655, 698)\nnow buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, with text span (706, 774)\nIt makes people in this area have no choice, with text span (776, 819)\nThey must take only a bus to go to another place, with text span (821, 869)\nIf a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them, with text span (871, 954)\npeople can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule, with text span (969, 1046)\nOn the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus, with text span (1048, 1098)\nit is waste of time, with text span (1486, 1505)\nthe buses provide merely two routes in this community, with text span (1186, 1239)\nIt is absolutely a major problem, with text span (1241, 1273)\nif a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus, with text span (1288, 1473)\nhaving more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars, with text span (1586, 1682)\npeople use less their own cars, with text span (1872, 1902)\npeople can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive, with text span (1733, 1819) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLessons with teachers versus others sources\n\nOver the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.\nMany people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.\nThose who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.\nPersonally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents learn far more from their teachers than from other source, with text span (1519, 1585)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nstudents at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers, with text span (419, 504)\nteachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong, with text span (1607, 1679)\nstudents learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, with text span (951, 1030)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nteachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten, with text span (522, 609)\nAnd when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers, with text span (611, 731)\nIt is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling, with text span (733, 790)\nstudents gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers, with text span (811, 929)\nThey can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it, with text span (1137, 1252)\nstudents learn things easily, with text span (1268, 1296)\nthey contend that good television programs do teach students, with text span (1308, 1368)\nDiscovery Channel has many instructive episodes, with text span (1384, 1431)\nStudents have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc, with text span (1433, 1492)\nwithin this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes, with text span (1052, 1135) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience\n\nStudying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.\nFirst of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. \nOne other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.\nMost important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. \nIn conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhere to learn a new language?\n\nAlthough there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.\nPerson 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.\nOn the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.\nOn the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.\nIn a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries, with text span (145, 337)\nadvantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language, with text span (1830, 1966)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nhe can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to, with text span (1149, 1276)\nWhen you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible, with text span (1523, 1738)\nPerson 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method, with text span (339, 453)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives, with text span (772, 909)\nHe may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country, with text span (911, 1017)\nit leads to better understanding of language essential skills, with text span (1029, 1090)\nHe also has access to the most up-to-date language, with text span (1092, 1142)\nThere are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language, with text span (1414, 1521)\nhe can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language, with text span (525, 599)\nhe is not jumping into the foreign country, with text span (471, 513)\nall these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way, with text span (666, 751)\nall the learners are probably from the same country, with text span (610, 661)\nif I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice, with text span (1292, 1412) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome important characteristics of a co-worker\n\nAt work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.\nThe co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.\nThe co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. \nFinally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship, with text span (446, 566)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe co-workers should believe in fellowship, with text span (2103, 2146)\nThe co-workers need to trust each other, with text span (1500, 1539)\nif the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment, with text span (1400, 1498)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThis helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships, with text span (2148, 2241)\nyou spend most of your day at office, with text span (2254, 2290)\nIf you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing, with text span (2292, 2356)\nThe co-workers should be cooperative with one another, with text span (568, 621)\nIf they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes, with text span (623, 679)\nThey should not act on suspicion, with text span (1541, 1573)\nhe always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not, with text span (744, 854)\nI once had a co-worker who was too family conscious, with text span (681, 732)\nMost of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person, with text span (856, 992)\none day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor, with text span (1003, 1081)\nWhen I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse, with text span (1083, 1208)\nFrom that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility, with text span (1210, 1377)\nThis is a very important aspect in the work environment, with text span (1575, 1630)\nI came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me, with text span (1632, 1750)\nTo a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him, with text span (1752, 1868)\nI never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me, with text span (1878, 1992)\nBut this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department, with text span (1994, 2091) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildhood is the happiest time of a person's life\n\nI agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.\nStarting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. \nAnother great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.\nUsing your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.\nChildhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildhood is the happiest period of one's life, with text span (83, 129)\nChildhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives, with text span (1698, 1764)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nIt's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think, with text span (131, 350)\nduring our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to, with text span (615, 715)\nchildhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most, with text span (1227, 1294)\nUsing your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child, with text span (1296, 1394)\nIt's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults, with text span (1766, 1886)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nBeing late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult, with text span (717, 864)\nStarting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives, with text span (352, 449)\nWe are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave, with text span (451, 539)\nEvery action we make are watched closely and judged by the community, with text span (541, 609)\nThere are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see, with text span (1123, 1214)\nAnother great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day, with text span (867, 1002)\nBeing a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you, with text span (1004, 1121)\nChildren are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination, with text span (1396, 1558)\nIn adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, with text span (1560, 1627)\nthey are in no way free to think or use their imagination, with text span (1639, 1696) END"}

Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSociety should ban all forms of the advertising\n\nIt is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.\nFirst of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.\nOn the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what's the best for us.\nThese days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.\nIn conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nSociety does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers, with text span (475, 635)\nmodern society needs advertising, with text span (1722, 1754)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nAds will keep us well informed about new products and services, with text span (1756, 1818)\nadvertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way, with text span (1857, 1943)\nadvertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited, with text span (678, 769)\nby advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services, with text span (1115, 1207)\nThese days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising, with text span (1307, 1393)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthese kind of ads will have negative effect to our children, with text span (778, 837)\nYoungsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis, with text span (839, 942)\nsome countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries, with text span (957, 1095)\nThanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what's the best for us, with text span (1209, 1305)\ntourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy, with text span (1408, 1466)\nIn order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers, with text span (1468, 1595)\nOnly well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country, with text span (1597, 1692) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSeveral languages are in danger of extinction\n\nIt is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.\nFirst and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.\nOn the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.\nIn a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nall languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible, with text span (1582, 1649)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nGovernments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting, with text span (715, 857)\nthere are some drawbacks from saving minority languages, with text span (1004, 1059)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country, with text span (419, 529)\nIt helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country, with text span (531, 604)\nThe clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist, with text span (606, 713)\nit is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more, with text span (873, 983)\ngovernments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results, with text span (1070, 1145)\nthere are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those, with text span (1168, 1274)\nThese kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular, with text span (1276, 1336)\nthe preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre, with text span (1351, 1463)\nIf they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money, with text span (1465, 1545) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA man 's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues\n\nOnce a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.\nFirst of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.\nSecondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.\nFinally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.\nAll in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world, with text span (1985, 2051)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\na person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression, with text span (542, 611)\npeople will get respect from politeness within each other, with text span (1102, 1159)\nthe society needs a civilized environment and orders, with text span (1587, 1639)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThrough those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible, with text span (613, 758)\nI worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers, with text span (773, 939)\nIn opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other, with text span (941, 1023)\nI will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job, with text span (1034, 1090)\nPoliteness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need, with text span (1161, 1299)\nA successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure, with text span (1301, 1376)\nThere are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, with text span (1378, 1470)\nfrom their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity, with text span (1480, 1576)\na degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities, with text span (1645, 1709)\nIn order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners, with text span (1711, 1852)\nBenefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate, with text span (1854, 1956) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPhysical exercise should be required part of every school day\n\nAlthough some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.\nPhysical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.\nDaily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.\nHaving children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. \nIncluding physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nphysical exercise is a crucial part of every school day, with text span (182, 237)\nIncluding physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered, with text span (1720, 1802)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nExercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind, with text span (239, 317)\nincluding exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age, with text span (332, 464)\nPhysical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier, with text span (466, 530)\nDaily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function, with text span (888, 954)\nHaving children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine, with text span (1293, 1447)\nIt will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules, with text span (1804, 2030)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school, with text span (559, 749)\nexercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues, with text span (764, 886)\nIt is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better, with text span (956, 1053)\nWhen people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in, with text span (1055, 1186)\nDaily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners, with text span (1188, 1291)\nChildren are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice, with text span (1449, 1602)\nthey can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life, with text span (1614, 1717) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCreativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions\n\nCreativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.\nTime and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.\nNonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.\nUnfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, \"Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open\". Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.\nHowever, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHigh schools must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum\n\nSome people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.\nTo begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.\nNext, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.\nLast but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.\nIn summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nNon academic subjects should be removed from syllabus\n\nStudents have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.\nTo begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students' health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people's health, it will also decrease their learning capability.\nIn addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.\nSome people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student's development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nschools should not remove these subjects, with text span (2039, 2079)\nnon-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that, with text span (256, 337)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nnon-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student's development, with text span (1939, 2026)\nRemoving physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people's health, it will also decrease their learning capability, with text span (816, 962)\nschool education should not only focus on the academic development of a student, with text span (1349, 1428)\nstudents can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents, with text span (1541, 1614)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nfrom the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects, with text span (354, 434)\nIf physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students' health, with text span (436, 551)\nafter studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes, with text span (567, 814)\nit is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life, with text span (1432, 1512)\nSuccess in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit, with text span (1145, 1341)\nschools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people, with text span (977, 1055)\nIt is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically, with text span (1057, 1143)\nit is not a good idea, with text span (1640, 1661)\nmost young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents, with text span (1670, 1796)\nparents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills, with text span (1808, 1898) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternational aid\n\nThe world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.\nInternational aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.\nDespite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.\nIn conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ninternational aid should be prioritised, with text span (431, 470)\npeople from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary, with text span (1593, 1722)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nInternational aid is critical, with text span (472, 501)\nit is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens, with text span (1123, 1177)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nMany people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards, with text span (580, 668)\nThey lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs, with text span (670, 759)\nWhat is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members, with text span (761, 974)\nthose people are in desperate need of international support, with text span (993, 1052)\nthere is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected, with text span (1255, 1343)\ncharity organisations are mainly funded by the home country, with text span (1190, 1249)\neven within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs, with text span (1369, 1465)\nBy solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth, with text span (1467, 1576)\npeople from other countries may be facing much more serious problems, with text span (510, 578) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMore people are migrating to other countries than ever before\n\nThe last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries' cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.\nFirstly, maintaining one's cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one's pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.\nSecondly, it is crucial to keep one's identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home.

However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.\nWith the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.\nFuture IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.\nIn conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer?\n\nPeople have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.\nFirst of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. \nSecondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.\nAnother reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.\nThe history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nOne of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about, with text span (192, 364)\nlearning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things, with text span (2135, 2211)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nlearning by doing things develops our maturity, with text span (493, 539)\nlearning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about, with text span (1034, 1150)\nwe become motivated to learn other things by doing them, with text span (2055, 2110)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWhen you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself, with text span (541, 605)\nYou will not be in need to refer to books or persons, with text span (607, 659)\nThe fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity, with text span (661, 765)\nif some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation, with text span (779, 933)\nWe can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading, with text span (935, 1021)\nThere are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them, with text span (1152, 1221)\nReading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing, with text span (1223, 1392)\nPeople who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming, with text span (1394, 1540)\nNor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming, with text span (1542, 1606)\nwe find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things, with text span (1760, 1825)\nWith the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring, with text span (1827, 1933)\nLearning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things, with text span (1935, 2050) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nImprove roads or public transports\n\nMany people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.\nFirst, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.\nSecond, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.\nLast but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.\nIn short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system, with text span (223, 299)\nspending money on improving public transportation is necessary, with text span (1565, 1627)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating, with text span (308, 386)\nthe using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation, with text span (395, 485)\npublic transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems, with text span (855, 918)\nthere is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting, with text span (1388, 1526)\nit is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in, with text span (1636, 1733)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up, with text span (558, 634)\nCars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource, with text span (487, 545)\nif the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower, with text span (653, 765)\nthis definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline, with text span (771, 845)\npublic transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars, with text span (931, 1005)\nIt means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes, with text span (1007, 1194)\nusing public transportation is much safer than private transportation, with text span (1216, 1285)\nAccording to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care, with text span (1287, 1381) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFinancial support for sports and social activities\n\nThere are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.\nFirst, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.\nSecond, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.\nMoreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.\nAll in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthese activities have the same efficient role in students' lives, with text span (387, 451)\nsports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money, with text span (1991, 2061)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThey bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way, with text span (2102, 2205)\nsports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health, with text span (932, 1000)\nsocial activities have same rights to receive monetary support, with text span (1467, 1529)\nthey bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments, with text span (1541, 1620)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nI decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well, with text span (854, 917)\nAfter that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted, with text span (794, 841)\nlast month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back, with text span (707, 792)\nbesides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness, with text span (518, 602)\nour body and moral health depend to physical activities directly, with text span (621, 685)\nbesides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life, with text span (1010, 1114)\nstudents should be prepared to present in society after their graduation, with text span (1140, 1212)\nsocial activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment, with text span (1219, 1309)\nsocial groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment, with text span (1326, 1461)\nIf we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation, with text span (1622, 1761)\nSuch activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends, with text span (1763, 1843)\nmore friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me, with text span (1864, 1949) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWe can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject\n\nThere is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.\nOn one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.\nFurthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.\nOn the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.\nIn conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject, with text span (1751, 1951)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmany different characters exist between male and female students, with text span (254, 318)\nboys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality, with text span (333, 407)\nit can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, with text span (1050, 1163)\nuniversities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, with text span (1484, 1589)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nMost of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases, with text span (409, 541)\nthere are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world, with text span (557, 645)\nMany boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts, with text span (647, 767)\ngirls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter, with text span (778, 897)\ngirls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect, with text span (915, 1035)\na girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, with text span (1260, 1343)\nthat does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development, with text span (1169, 1245)\nthis could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects, with text span (1595, 1648)\nIt would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender, with text span (1650, 1734)\nshe is unlikely to focus on her subject, with text span (1349, 1388)\nthis also can block the girl's future development and career prospect, with text span (1394, 1463) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDrugs, alcohol and messy sex lives\n\nCelebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.\nThe first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.\nMeanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo guns can really increase the level of violence?\n\nThe number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.\nOn the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.\nOn the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence, with text span (1570, 1655)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsome military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence, with text span (851, 965)\nthere are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities, with text span (986, 1074)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public, with text span (737, 836)\na police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun, with text span (400, 496)\nAn obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him, with text span (498, 665)\npolice officers can force a criminal to surrender, with text span (678, 727)\nthe number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries, with text span (1085, 1191)\nMany well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably, with text span (1193, 1280)\ncost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs, with text span (1292, 1456)\nMany baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance, with text span (1458, 1533) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInfluence of large factories\n\nNowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.\nFirst of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.\nThe main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.\nHowever, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.\nIn conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGender Equality at university admission\n\nNowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.\nUniversities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. \nHowever, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDiscuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion\n\nOn these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.\nOn the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. \nOn the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.\nTo sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception.

The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice.

For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.\nSecondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDormitory or apartment?\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. \nOn the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. \nOn the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. \nFrom given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome prefer to work for a company, some prefer to work for themselves\n\nThere are many kinds of jobs in society.

There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. \nIn the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others.

Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.\nFinally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.\nThere is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEvery student either male or female should be given equal opportunity\n \nIn today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. \nTo begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. \nFurthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. \nIn conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthere should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses, with text span (238, 364)\nevery student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender, with text span (1592, 1829)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\njudging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular, with text span (470, 607)\nfemale students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females, with text span (931, 1112)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nboth male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education, with text span (619, 758)\nIn India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations, with text span (760, 915)\ndue to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure, with text span (1127, 1356)\nChanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector, with text span (1371, 1536) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nKeeping animals in zoos\n\nSince the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.\nFirst, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.\nOn the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.\nIn conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nmore good come from zoos than bad, with text span (1818, 1851)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nboth of the arguments have strong supports, with text span (1754, 1796)\nkeeping animals in captivity is wrong, with text span (366, 403)\nzoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology, with text span (1016, 1114)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nanimals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom, with text span (412, 507)\nThis is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures, with text span (509, 615)\nmany zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require, with text span (634, 751)\nThe animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment, with text span (753, 858)\nsometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe, with text span (873, 967)\nMany people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world, with text span (1116, 1294)\nZoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public, with text span (1296, 1383)\nzoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life, with text span (1391, 1502)\nin zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters, with text span (1534, 1687)\nzoos are needed to keep the nature balanced, with text span (1694, 1737) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe precondition of doing research by professors\n\nNowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.\nTo begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors' duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.\nOn the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.\nNevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.\nConsequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students' solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nProfessors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way, with text span (2528, 2611)\nprofessors should spend more time on preparing courses than research, with text span (285, 353)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nOnly by developing students, can we have a better academic field, with text span (2462, 2526)\nthe research takes up too much teaching time, with text span (213, 257)\nprofessors could teach students through research and projects, with text span (1582, 1643)\nprofessor should concern about preparing class, with text span (2234, 2280)\nprofessors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research, with text span (908, 998)\nspending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research, with text span (1460, 1566)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nconducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent, with text span (2296, 2369)\nthe precondition of doing research is growing students' solid theory fundamental, with text span (2380, 2460)\nresearch could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, with text span (146, 211)\nprofessors should assist students to acquire knowledge, with text span (387, 441)\nThe professors' duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses, with text span (443, 517)\nIf professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes, with text span (519, 661)\nThe reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies, with text span (663, 757)\nprofessors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students, with text span (772, 895)\nif professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities, with text span (1019, 1158)\nStudents are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline, with text span (1160, 1259)\nMany students would not choose these kinds of universities to study, with text span (1261, 1328)\nhardly can professors find assistants to help with projects, with text span (1343, 1402)\nSome students enjoy taking part in some research, with text span (1645, 1693)\nThrough to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research, with text span (1695, 1806)\nelectronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car, with text span (1822, 1911)\nThey can manage the electric theory in practical skills, with text span (1913, 1968)\nAnd some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions, with text span (1970, 2032)\nonly under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research, with text span (2043, 2159)\nThis is requires professors provide high quality courses, with text span (2161, 2217)\nIt is adverse to the whole academic field, with text span (1404, 1445) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUnder suitable administration, tourism enhances local economic development\n\nTourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.\nThe most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.\nSome people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.\nAfter careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthrough proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas, with text span (400, 547)\nthe tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages, with text span (2168, 2242)\nit is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks, with text span (2259, 2355)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThe most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region, with text span (549, 657)\nSome people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism, with text span (1465, 1562)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThis takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry, with text span (659, 858)\nThe increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs, with text span (860, 1022)\ntourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry, with text span (1037, 1199)\nThis increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes, with text span (1201, 1361)\nthis gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return, with text span (1376, 1463)\ncompared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers, with text span (1573, 1693)\npaper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution, with text span (1709, 1817)\nthe dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated, with text span (1838, 1995)\nIt is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so, with text span (1997, 2107) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould all the advertisements be banned?\n\nNever in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.\nFirst, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.\nBesides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.\nThat is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.\nTaken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEducation plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country\n\nEducation is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.\nIn a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.\nDevelopment through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.\nIn conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo you believe that elderly people used to live in a better world?\n\nChanges are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.\nWe live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. \nThe phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.\nIn conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nin the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically, with text span (2269, 2395)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe people from older generation may claim they had better life, with text span (1980, 2043)\nWe live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place, with text span (460, 585)\nthe increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine, with text span (1797, 1951)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthere were stronger bonds between family members and friends, with text span (2047, 2107)\nthey judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice, with text span (2139, 2199)\nA clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones, with text span (587, 663)\nThe strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts, with text span (665, 803)\nsocial networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago, with text span (976, 1190)\nsome people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication, with text span (815, 952)\nThe phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in, with text span (1193, 1361)\neven some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists, with text span (1370, 1561)\nThe advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives, with text span (1563, 1644)\nscientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough, with text span (1662, 1783) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSuccessful people do something new or take risks\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.\nThe first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.\nMoreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.\nAdmittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nsuccessful people still do things they already know, with text span (493, 544)\ndoing what we already known can still leads us to succeed, with text span (2391, 2448)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite, with text span (2457, 2528)\nsuccessful people do not have to try new things or take risks, with text span (1165, 1226)\nit is not necessary for successful people to take risks, with text span (1836, 1891)\ndoing something new is necessary for people to success, with text span (1973, 2027)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nto be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter, with text span (608, 674)\nThe lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own, with text span (676, 762)\nConsider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment, with text span (764, 865)\nHe can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income, with text span (867, 999)\nHe does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time, with text span (1001, 1122)\nit depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not, with text span (1277, 1352)\na successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success, with text span (1364, 1450)\nthe sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills, with text span (1466, 1562)\nThe same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm, with text span (1564, 1661)\nthose athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed, with text span (1676, 1780)\nthey can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success, with text span (2036, 2123)\nTry something new can indeed make people become special, with text span (2242, 2297)\nwhile it does not mean successful, with text span (2299, 2332) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHow to learn children more efficiently\n\nEducation is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.\nTo begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. \nSecondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternational tourism is now more common than ever before\n\nThe last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.\nFirstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.\nSecondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia's Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat's anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOnce you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success\n\nAchieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.\nFirst, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.\nSecond, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.\nIn conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nonce you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success, with text span (391, 456)\nbeing different and unique is the better way to achieve success, with text span (1786, 1849)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nIf you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you, with text span (701, 872)\nbeing unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others, with text span (1079, 1152)\nIt not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success, with text span (1851, 1970)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report, with text span (899, 977)\nI was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently, with text span (986, 1069)\nbeing positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others, with text span (465, 584)\nAs living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game, with text span (586, 653)\nOnly who has the sharpest weapon can survive, with text span (655, 699)\nTake the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example, with text span (1345, 1421)\nThe reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors, with text span (1423, 1569)\nIt has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers, with text span (1571, 1704)\nIt is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value, with text span (1706, 1769)\nonce you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you, with text span (1170, 1343) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEstablishing a new university in your community\n\nI will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.\nThis new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.\nUndoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. \nHowever, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHigh sales reflect power of advertising and not the real need\n\nNowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.\nTo boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.\nHowever, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.\nThe power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSpending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life\n\nDespite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.\nThe first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. \nOf course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.\nAnother reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.\nWhen you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.\nIn sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nother prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends, with text span (257, 315)\nspending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life, with text span (1873, 1944)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nstaying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences, with text span (384, 498)\na large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded, with text span (1121, 1244)\nWhen you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, with text span (1477, 1614)\nwhile differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement, with text span (773, 897)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\namong a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before, with text span (514, 759)\nif you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages, with text span (1259, 1475)\nthey often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience, with text span (1638, 1733)\nThis would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends, with text span (899, 1011)\nin this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same, with text span (1022, 1096) END"}

However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.\nA strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.\nOn the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.\nIn my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nModern cooking methods have improved our life-style significantly\n\nWith technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.\nFirst of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.\nAt the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.\nIn conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHow teachers can make the subject interesting to students!\n\nThere are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.\nFirst of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.\nSecond, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.\nIn conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school, with text span (340, 491)\nusing life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, with text span (1977, 2137)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own, with text span (2156, 2276)\nby explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject, with text span (507, 697)\nby bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving, with text span (1431, 1592)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTake chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class, with text span (699, 1000)\nWhile I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas, with text span (1002, 1204)\nThis type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good, with text span (1206, 1282)\nI connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore, with text span (1284, 1421)\nThis will address students' interests, with text span (1594, 1631)\nit's the assignment that needs real life participation, with text span (1640, 1694)\nin law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them, with text span (1709, 1863)\nWhen any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react, with text span (1865, 1960) END"}

After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.\nAlso, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.\nLast, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.\nAlthough it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nHaving one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits, with text span (274, 359)\nit is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work, with text span (1804, 1898)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, with text span (1624, 1685)\nhaving hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit, with text span (368, 440)\nhaving hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind, with text span (947, 999)\nwe should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured, with text span (1274, 1397)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ndoing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness, with text span (1691, 1787)\ndoing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted, with text span (507, 589)\nLooking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, with text span (442, 502)\nMy neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company, with text span (591, 652)\nHe ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise, with text span (654, 710)\nWhen he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight, with text span (712, 807)\nHe started to jog every morning, with text span (809, 840)\nAfter a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend, with text span (842, 892)\ndoing something for a long time can be boring, with text span (900, 945)\nat school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class, with text span (1014, 1129)\nHumans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours, with text span (1131, 1197)\nDoing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries, with text span (1199, 1266)\nPlaying musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar, with text span (1399, 1468)\nWhen I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves, with text span (1470, 1560)\nIt makes me feel better and gives me the confidence, with text span (1562, 1613) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIt is not necessary for university students to attend classes\n\nThough out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. \nFirstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.\nSecondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.\nAdmittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.\nAll in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam, with text span (400, 482)\nthe university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test, with text span (2121, 2215)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nnot only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated, with text span (2224, 2359)\nthe students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject, with text span (537, 602)\nthe university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not, with text span (1874, 2023)\nif the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated, with text span (1253, 1392)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nI don't like electronics, with text span (637, 661)\nelectronics cannot always be seen in the real world, with text span (671, 722)\nAnd I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics, with text span (724, 786)\nBut I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics, with text span (788, 861)\nAnd if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again, with text span (863, 1025)\nLuckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach, with text span (1027, 1115)\nAnd I can study physics without consideration of my electronics, with text span (1117, 1180)\nAnd at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam, with text span (1182, 1241)\nthe benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points, with text span (2029, 2107)\nIf one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes, with text span (1394, 1489)\nAnd the students will have nothing to do in the campus, with text span (1491, 1545)\nhe or she will play online games days and nights, with text span (1552, 1600)\nThe academic achievement will decline, with text span (1602, 1639)\nthis student will become a loser in the world, with text span (1653, 1698)\nAnd all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class, with text span (1700, 1780)\nThis is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system, with text span (1782, 1860) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology designed to make people's lives simpler often make them more complicated\n\nMany people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.\nOf course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. \nNext, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of.

As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.\nTraditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance.

Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.\nSome people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.\nAll in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to, with text span (338, 405)\nprotection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation, with text span (1813, 1936)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nTraditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit, with text span (407, 549)\nprotecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes, with text span (1320, 1411)\nthe government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them, with text span (1617, 1799)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ntechnology takes convenience to humankind, with text span (560, 601)\nit also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle, with text span (603, 679)\ntraditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance, with text span (690, 805)\ntraditional skills rely little on fossil energy, with text span (839, 886)\nit is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change, with text span (888, 988)\nthose tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values, with text span (1002, 1070)\nThese are important foundation of modern civilization, with text span (1072, 1125)\nProtection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems, with text span (1127, 1258)\nthis kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, with text span (1434, 1504)\nthe expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions, with text span (1535, 1605) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEvery experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life\n\nI agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.\nThe best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.\nAll inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.\nOur difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. \nTherefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nexperience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life, with text span (266, 366)\nevery experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life, with text span (2063, 2166)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthose challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life, with text span (541, 648)\nAll inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations, with text span (800, 873)\nOur difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly, with text span (1303, 1371)\nGood experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life, with text span (2168, 2245)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nEvery day comes with new challenges for them like walking, with text span (464, 521)\nwhen they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times, with text span (663, 740)\nthey slowly tune their technique and learned to walk, with text span (746, 798)\nNo known scientist has success in first attempt, with text span (875, 922)\nScientists try and test many specimens before they get they want, with text span (924, 988)\nThomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb, with text span (1007, 1074)\nall the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through, with text span (1080, 1301)\nfirst time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known, with text span (1647, 1720)\nI had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them, with text span (1722, 1855)\nI also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills, with text span (1857, 1982)\nWhen I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me, with text span (1551, 1638)\nWe might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves, with text span (1373, 1549) END"}

In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.\nFirst of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.\nNext, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.\nLastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she\/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.\nIn conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well.

In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.\nTo begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.\nAs for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.\nTo sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say, with text span (1396, 1677)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nstudents can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to, with text span (388, 506)\ncompanies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation, with text span (1295, 1383)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nstudents might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation, with text span (649, 772)\nIn most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom, with text span (508, 634)\nthe internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy, with text span (791, 880)\nAs for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money, with text span (882, 951)\nthey can start looking for potential employees and begin the training, with text span (1213, 1282)\nthe younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan, with text span (966, 1202) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUsing a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects\n\nIn today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.\nThe best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.\nNowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAlternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion\n\nRecently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.\nFirstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.\nSecondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.\nIn order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.\nIn summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nalternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced, with text span (358, 464)\nalternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion, with text span (2393, 2565)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsome people claim the convenience of automobile, with text span (2325, 2372)\nit is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles, with text span (822, 933)\nthe methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented, with text span (1221, 1351)\nalternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively, with text span (1387, 1507)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nan increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution, with text span (561, 638)\nautomobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, with text span (646, 721)\nthe air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants, with text span (723, 809)\nan increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion, with text span (945, 1020)\nOnce we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while, with text span (1022, 1098)\ntraffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents, with text span (1115, 1213)\nalternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal, with text span (1536, 1623)\nrental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries, with text span (1638, 1709)\nThis system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee, with text span (1711, 1860)\nbicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, with text span (1868, 1925)\nit is a better form to protect environment than automobile, with text span (1927, 1985)\nthese attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution, with text span (2207, 2299)\nthe introduction of international laws can be also effective, with text span (2012, 2072)\nthere are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only, with text span (2088, 2199) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose\n\nSome people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.\nFirst of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.\nSecondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.\nLast but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. \nIn conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversity education should be only available for good students\n\nThe purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.\nFirst, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.\nSecondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.\nTo sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners, with text span (309, 419)\neveryone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students, with text span (1944, 2082)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThis will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most, with text span (2084, 2202)\nfocusing only on talented students is a better option, with text span (428, 481)\nuniversity should only accept good students, with text span (1057, 1100)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality, with text span (490, 558)\nUnlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge, with text span (560, 715)\nsome students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones, with text span (726, 840)\nThat explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, with text span (842, 960)\nthey need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone, with text span (968, 1045)\nit gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes, with text span (1109, 1167)\nthis may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', with text span (1192, 1296)\nit gives no harm to the whole community, with text span (1311, 1350)\nThose standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions, with text span (1352, 1522)\nlimiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice, with text span (1532, 1614)\nit will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves, with text span (1621, 1774)\nthis improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society, with text span (1788, 1912) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology that widen the gap between rich and poor?\n\nTechnology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.\nIn the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.\nSecondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.\nUndoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.\nIn conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable.

Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.\nThe first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together.

People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.\nSecond, the environment today is serious damaged.

What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChallenges are different from generation to generation\n\nWhile debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.\nFirst, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. \nSecond, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. \nIn conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification.

Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.\nFame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace.

As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor\/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.\nIn conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHuman needs vs saving land for endangered animals\n\nIn the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.\nFirst, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.\nIn addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.\nIn conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwe clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment, with text span (394, 456)\nwe definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions, with text span (1809, 1966)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe natural diversity is very important for further generations, with text span (492, 555)\na stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather, with text span (1156, 1221)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIf we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet, with text span (557, 660)\nAs we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem, with text span (662, 795)\nevery day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland, with text span (812, 913)\nIf we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct, with text span (915, 1044)\nfurther generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals, with text span (1059, 1141)\nOur behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming, with text span (1223, 1356)\nThis not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans, with text span (1358, 1423)\nwe are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes, with text span (1432, 1500)\nrecent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average, with text span (1515, 1651)\nThis will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate, with text span (1653, 1743) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhich do you prefer: do only what you already do well, or not.\n\nYou may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.\nFocusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.\nIf you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.\nIn summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nyou should focus on what you are good at, with text span (415, 455)\ndoing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better, with text span (1777, 1869)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nyou will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well, with text span (1073, 1160)\nby doing what you are good at, you will be better at it, with text span (1708, 1763)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be, with text span (530, 629)\nAlbert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity, with text span (645, 819)\nhe hardly cared about something else, with text span (830, 866)\nIt is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup, with text span (868, 958)\nusing two different soups properly was quite annoying, with text span (986, 1039)\nFocusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal, with text span (457, 513)\nWhen you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it, with text span (1236, 1324)\nyou will motivate yourself to do more, with text span (1332, 1369)\nI used to be good at math when I was in junior high school, with text span (1391, 1449)\nI was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, with text span (1459, 1522)\nI became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems, with text span (1524, 1593)\nI could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems, with text span (1608, 1700)\nIf you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it, with text span (1162, 1234) END"}
