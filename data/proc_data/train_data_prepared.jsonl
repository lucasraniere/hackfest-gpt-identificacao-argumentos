{"prompt":"Factor of choosing a career.\n\nIn many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.\nTo begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.\nFurther and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 141 174\tthe salary is very pivotal factor\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nT2\tMajorClaim 189 268\tthere are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard\nT3\tMajorClaim 1318 1385\tI disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators\nT4\tClaim 1390 1512\tthere are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 543 690\tPeople, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary\nT6\tClaim 298 380\tin order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well\nA3\tStance T6 Against\nT7\tPremise 391 541\taspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tClaim 948 1116\tcareer promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary\nA4\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 808 930\tmost of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1131 1301\tpeople, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\n"}

{"prompt":"Some young adults want independence from their parents quickly\n\nMany young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. \nLiving in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.\nAnother problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.\nIn conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have.

It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation.

{"prompt":"Large amount of violence in television programs\n\nExcessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. \nAdmittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.\nNevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. \nIn conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 306 491\tgovernments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable\nT2\tMajorClaim 1800 1908\tviolent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency\nT3\tPremise 506 615\treducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate\nT4\tPremise 676 774\tgovernments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs\nT5\tPremise 776 874\tAs a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong\nT6\tPremise 902 1046\tby watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes\nT7\tClaim 1059 1216\tit would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies\nA1\tStance T7 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 1420 1500\tadults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day\nT9\tPremise 1502 1581\tFor whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment\nT10\tPremise 1583 1761\tConsidering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them\nT11\tClaim 1232 1406\tit would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences\nA3\tStance T11 Against\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Environmental protection vs Economic developments\n\nEnvironmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. \nFirst, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. \nSecond, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.\nSome people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.\nIn conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves? \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 365 460\ttackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments\nT2\tPremise 761 793\twe will all perish as she's gone\nT3\tPremise 795 903\tJust like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well\nT4\tPremise 657 752\tWithout Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain\nT5\tPremise 573 655\tAll the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one\nT6\tClaim 501 571\tenvironmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments\nA1\tStance T6 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 1006 1122\tEnvironmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems\nT8\tPremise 1124 1255\tTake global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together\nT9\tPremise 1257 1463\tThe melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator\nT10\tPremise 1471 1508\tthe rising sea water could drown them\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tPremise 1510 1564\tEnvironmental issues can not be divided by nationality\nT12\tPremise 1573 1635\tall humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tClaim 914 1004\tthe influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues\nA2\tStance T13 For\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nT14\tPremise 1759 1936\tif the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away\nT15\tPremise 1947 2084\tthe truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now\nT16\tClaim 1666 1739\teconomic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside\nA3\tStance T16 Against\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T16\t\nR12\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\nT17\tPremise 2086 2269\tIt would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages\nR13\tattacks Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nT18\tMajorClaim 2286 2407\tenvironmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence\n"}
{"prompt":"Spending money on supporting art or protecting environment\n\nIf I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. \nFirst, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.\nFurthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising.

{"prompt":"Young people should go to university or not\n\nPersistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.\nTo begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.\nHowever, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.\nTo sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2029 2252\tthe benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges\nT2\tClaim 1968 2027\thigher education does not guarantee young students' success\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tClaim 977 1118\tit is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming\nA2\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 618 771\tthere are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers\nT5\tPremise 791 831\tlabors for graduates are in short supply\nT6\tPremise 848 960\tthe labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 1201 1342\tuniversities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1344 1408\tThese academic values are necessary to the progress of the world\nT9\tPremise 1428 1552\tmany researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society\nT10\tPremise 1605 1690\tdiverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently\nT11\tPremise 1699 1812\tthere are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\n"}

In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology.

From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.\nTo begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.\nFurther, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.\nHowever, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense.

{"prompt":"Extraordinarily cautious is important since rough work is intolerable\n\nThis current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.\nPrimarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.\nSecondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. \nBesides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.\nTo sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2388 2441\tit is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious\nT2\tClaim 2448 2506\trough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 2340 2386\twe need to catch up with the pace of the world\nA2\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tMajorClaim 431 486\tit might not be the most beneficial move to our society\nT5\tClaim 357 420\tfast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world\nA3\tStance T5 Against\nT6\tClaim 499 568\teven when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy\nA4\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 570 637\tEven simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy\nT8\tPremise 639 820\tIf we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline\nT9\tPremise 832 890\tit only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless\nT10\tPremise 892 991\tIt is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it\nT11\tPremise 1003 1090\tit may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times\nT12\tPremise 1096 1186\twith consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nT13\tPremise 1544 1613\tWe soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace\nT14\tPremise 1620 1707\twhen the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tPremise 1709 1802\tThis might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nT16\tClaim 1346 1542\tEven when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients\nA5\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 1198 1344\tother than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T16\t\nT18\tPremise 2013 2144\tA miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars\nT19\tPremise 2169 2317\teven when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems\nT20\tClaim 1867 1912\tSome work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all\nA6\tStance T20 For\nT21\tPremise 1928 2011\tin official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T20\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T21\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T21\t\n"}

Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.\nThe use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air.

{"prompt":"Gun control and increasing violence\n\nSome people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. \nFirst of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. \nIn fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. \nMoreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. \nAll in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 215 275\tcriminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control\nT2\tMajorClaim 1130 1220\tthere is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate\nT3\tClaim 1241 1291\tcriminal mind seems to be more related to violence\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 317 370\tif there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease\nA2\tStance T4 Against\nT5\tPremise 379 415\tfewer guns available mean less crime\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 426 460\tthis is not as simple as it sounds\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT7\tClaim 472 530\tstringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 539 598\tmost gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally\nT9\tPremise 600 761\tPeople who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nT10\tClaim 954 1096\tif a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 882 941\tthe root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself\nT12\tPremise 774 867\tthere will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Zoos should be built to protect rural animals\n\nPreserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.\nTo begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.\nNevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.\nBy way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1757 1798\twild animals should be set free from zoos\nT2\tMajorClaim 353 408\tanimals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos\nT3\tClaim 643 731\tit is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 425 504\tit is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings\nT5\tPremise 506 641\tGiven the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tClaim 1107 1191\tzoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 1032 1091\tthe wild species would suffer from isolation and depression\nT8\tPremise 861 1017\tif rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures\nT9\tPremise 745 849\tthe limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT10\tClaim 1235 1350\tzoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside\nA3\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tPremise 1380 1455\tthe endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 1487 1595\tthe strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tPremise 1611 1712\tthe growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nT14\tClaim 1816 1903\tthey have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression\nA4\tStance T14 For\n"}
{"prompt":"We can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject\n\nThere is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.\nOn one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.\nFurthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.\nOn the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.\nIn conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 254 318\tmany different characters exist between male and female students\nA1\tStance T1 For\nT2\tMajorClaim 1751 1951\tit is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject\nT3\tPremise 409 541\tMost of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases\nT4\tPremise 557 645\tthere are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world\nT5\tPremise 647 767\tMany boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts\nT6\tPremise 778 897\tgirls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter\nT7\tPremise 915 1035\tgirls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect\nT8\tClaim 333 407\tboys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1260 1343\ta girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department\nT10\tClaim 1050 1163\tit can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1169 1245\tthat does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development\nT12\tClaim 1484 1589\tuniversities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities\nA5\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1595 1648\tthis could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects\nT14\tPremise 1650 1734\tIt would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender\nT15\tPremise 1349 1388\tshe is unlikely to focus on her subject\nT16\tPremise 1394 1463\tthis also can block the girl's future development and career prospect\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T10\t\n"}

Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.\nWhat is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities.

{"prompt":"Disagree Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed!\n\nIt is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. \nFirst and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. \nSecond, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. \nAdmittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. \nIn conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games.

{"prompt":"Younger school children should study art and music\n\nUndoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.\nFirst of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. \nIn addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.\nAdmittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.\nIn a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 633 678\tthe art and music should be required to study\nT2\tClaim 349 443\tthe art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 452 587\tthose subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tPremise 776 966\tIt is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures\nT5\tPremise 993 1140\tlearning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures\nT6\tPremise 1156 1295\tstudents are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tClaim 694 774\tart and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful\nA2\tStance T7 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 1413 1624\twith the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself\nT9\tPremise 1626 1751\tArt and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life\nT10\tPremise 1753 1970\tWhen enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for\nT11\tPremise 1988 2080\tthey would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved\nT12\tPremise 2094 2157\tthis sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art\nT13\tClaim 1311 1400\tstudying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax\nA3\tStance T13 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T13\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T13\t\nT14\tPremise 2171 2251\tthe study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest\nT15\tClaim 2328 2492\tthe school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure\nA5\tStance T15 For\nT16\tPremise 2253 2320\tThe education of art and music would not work if students resist it\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nT17\tMajorClaim 2659 2733\tyounger students' art and music education should not take the second place\nT18\tClaim 2509 2657\tin the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure\nA4\tStance T18 For\n"}

{"prompt":"Prohibit public smoking?\n\nThe awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.\nFirstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.\nSecondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.\nTo sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation.

{"prompt":"Using animals for the benefit of the human beings\n\nWith the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.\nFirst of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.\nThough animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life.

{"prompt":"The maintenance of traditional skills and ways of life?\n\nThere is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.\nIt is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.\nIn tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.\nTo sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life.

{"prompt":"Roommates quality and their importance\n\nMuch has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. \nConsideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.\nMoreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.\nIn conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1633 1720\tConsideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality\nT2\tMajorClaim 315 374\tthe most important quality of roommates is being considered\nT3\tMajorClaim 393 465\tcommunication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate\nT4\tPremise 468 517\tConsideration is always important in relationship\nT5\tPremise 532 596\troommate turns down the music or television volume at night time\nT6\tPremise 598 684\tSometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine\nT7\tPremise 686 830\tAt all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously\nT8\tClaim 843 918\thaving a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 920 1004\tIt will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1016 1063\tcommunication is as well making a good roommate\nT11\tPremise 1456 1549\tThrough communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others\nT12\tClaim 1380 1411\tcommunication is very important\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1065 1147\tPeople have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning\nT14\tPremise 1149 1237\tOne might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project\nT15\tPremise 1239 1367\tIf one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T8\t\nT16\tPremise 1415 1454\tit would clear up the misinterpretation\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Problems and benefits of international tourism\n\nAlong with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.\nI admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.\nHowever, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.\nFurthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.\nIn conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1891 1966\tthe prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale\nT2\tClaim 1977 2011\tthere are some inevitable problems\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 2013 2094\tthey are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tPremise 340 537\tIn order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats\nT5\tPremise 539 723\tTourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels\nT6\tClaim 277 338\ttourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment\nA2\tStance T6 Against\nT7\tPremise 763 856\ttourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 947 1115\tHoliday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment\nT9\tPremise 1117 1264\tBoth local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well\nT10\tPremise 1281 1380\tthe revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment\nT11\tClaim 867 945\tflourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy\nA4\tStance T11 For\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nT12\tClaim 1395 1463\tthe increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well\nA5\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1465 1563\tThe provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably\nT14\tPremise 1565 1681\tWith adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing\nT15\tPremise 1696 1874\tboth locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\n"}

As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.\nBig city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.\nAt the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.\nA night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.\nWhat's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside.

{"prompt":"Luck vs hard work\n\nThere are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.\nFirst, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.\nSecondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. \nThirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. \nAlthough it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 244 297\tit is one's hard work that helps him reach his target\nT2\tClaim 125 192\tI do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 2273 2295\tit is good to be lucky\nT4\tClaim 2297 2341\tdepending on luck for everything is not good\nA3\tStance T4 For\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nT5\tMajorClaim 2349 2443\tI strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does\nT6\tClaim 306 390\tif you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 392 478\tLuck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way\nT8\tPremise 480 534\tIf it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment\nT9\tClaim 687 750\tall my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck\nA4\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 756 817\tI never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tPremise 544 658\tif you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT13\tClaim 936 1033\tthose who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination\nA6\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1035 1169\tThey carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal\nT15\tPremise 1171 1244\tIf you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading\nT16\tPremise 1259 1399\ta friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery\nT17\tPremise 1401 1486\tHe was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery\nT18\tPremise 1497 1576\tup to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T13\t\nT12\tClaim 1588 1700\tif you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target\nA5\tStance T12 For\nT19\tPremise 1715 1758\tmy boss worked tirelessly for his promotion\nT20\tPremise 1760 1829\tHe looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion\nT21\tPremise 1831 1938\tHe realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors\nT22\tPremise 1949 2065\the had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply\nT23\tPremise 2067 2195\tAt the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship\nT24\tPremise 2202 2261\the had more credentials than other officers in his capacity\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T24 Arg2:T23\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T12\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T12\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T12\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T12\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"One or two close friends vs. a large number of casual acquaintances\n\nThere is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.\nWe can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.\nSecond, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business.

{"prompt":"Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom\n\nDuring these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.\nFirst, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.\nSecond, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.\nLastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.\nIn conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T2\tMajorClaim 1780 1840\ttraditional learning still has many benefits to the students\nT1\tClaim 347 382\tonline classes have many advantages\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nT3\tMajorClaim 392 429\tI prefer traditional learning classes\nT4\tClaim 458 560\tthe participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 562 636\tWorking in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class\nT6\tPremise 652 753\tthe discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas\nT7\tPremise 755 850\tUnlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends\nT8\tClaim 860 918\tclassroom learning provides other activities than studying\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 920 1058\tDuring student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library\nT10\tPremise 1060 1117\tThese activities lead to more interact with their friends\nT11\tPremise 1119 1170\tConnection with friends improves their IQ abilities\nT12\tPremise 1185 1234\tthey have a chance to learn about their societies\nT13\tPremise 1242 1297\tthe online course keeps the children at their home only\nT14\tClaim 1307 1399\tin school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice\nA4\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1401 1443\tThe professor provides good answers to you\nT16\tPremise 1445 1528\tThey do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem\nT17\tPremise 1543 1623\tin distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important\nT18\tPremise 1625 1670\tThe professor has been assigned to teach only\nT19\tPremise 1682 1763\tthere will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T8\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit?\n\nMan has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.\nHuman being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.\nOn the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.\nFrom my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1591 1678\thuman being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters\nT2\tClaim 1680 1735\tAnimal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 474 598\tHuman being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 600 717\tLikewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation\nT5\tPremise 719 877\tMany people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples\nT6\tPremise 879 924\tThey are kept for security purposes in houses\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 945 1004\tmany farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1020 1111\tcows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation\nT9\tPremise 1113 1175\tThis in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle\nT10\tClaim 1190 1309\tthousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1311 1381\tAnother example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights\nT12\tPremise 1383 1513\tMany other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster\nT13\tPremise 1515 1568\tAnd above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T7\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Effect of celebrities on youth\n\nYoung people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. \nFirst of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.\nSecondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.\nThus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 226 278\tfollowing celebrities can be dangerous for the youth\nT2\tMajorClaim 1524 1623\twhen young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way\nT3\tClaim 1625 1694\tThis has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 508 587\tMany young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age\nT5\tPremise 602 833\tin a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes\nT6\tPremise 868 945\timitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals\nT7\tClaim 443 506\tfollowing celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents\nA3\tStance T7 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 1061 1159\tAdolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior\nT9\tPremise 1174 1366\trecently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools\nT10\tPremise 977 1059\twhen youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way\nT11\tClaim 1407 1484\tthese glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people\nA5\tStance T11 For\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\n"}

There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.\nOn one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.\nBesides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people.

For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment.

{"prompt":"Teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects\n\nRecently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. \nIn the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.\nFurthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. \nLast but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.\nIn conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 359 430\tthe teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects\nT2\tMajorClaim 1680 1726\tteachers are the best for children's education\nT3\tClaim 1728 1921\tNot only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 542 673\tto be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge\nT5\tPremise 684 813\tin comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics\nT6\tClaim 453 526\tschool teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education\nA2\tStance T6 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tClaim 828 929\tteaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 944 1174\tafter many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills\nT9\tPremise 1189 1340\tparents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nT10\tClaim 1616 1663\tit was impossible for them to be a good teacher\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1363 1447\tcompared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children\nT12\tPremise 1449 1541\tNowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work\nT13\tPremise 1549 1608\tthere is only limited time for them to teach their children\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Sense of cooperation\n\nIn present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.\nA strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.\nOn the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.\nIn my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work.

{"prompt":"Society should ban all forms of the advertising\n\nIt is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.\nFirst of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.\nOn the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.\nThese days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy.

{"prompt":"Paying taxes is enough contribution from citizens\n\nPaying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.\nTo start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.\nHowever, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.\nIn conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T2\tMajorClaim 1843 1944\tthey have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way\nT3\tPremise 340 439\tit is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens\nT4\tPremise 454 548\ta large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability\nT5\tPremise 558 611\tevery one can work and live in a peaceful environment\nT6\tPremise 613 736\tThe tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers\nT7\tPremise 747 791\tthese workers do not produce profit directly\nT8\tPremise 793 848\twhat they do is for the well-being of the whole society\nT9\tClaim 271 335\tall people who are able to work should pay tax to the government\nA1\tStance T9 For\nT10\tClaim 878 956\tcitizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax\nA2\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 970 1066\tthere are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others\nT12\tPremise 1084 1147\tthe government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties\nT13\tPremise 1153 1199\tsuch financial help is usually far from enough\nT14\tPremise 1215 1336\taids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support\nT15\tPremise 1338 1448\tAnother responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force\nT16\tPremise 1450 1550\tThere are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited\nT17\tPremise 1555 1736\tit is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T9\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T10\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T10\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career\n\nWhen choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. \nFirst of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.\nNevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. \nSome may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.\nIn considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 283 362\tchoosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career\nT2\tMajorClaim 2281 2341\tparents can lead their children to a more smooth career path\nT3\tClaim 2188 2269\tone can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 379 425\tas parents are involved in the same environmen\nT5\tPremise 553 662\tmy father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge\nT6\tPremise 664 725\tWhenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting\nT7\tPremise 735 758\the has many experiences\nT8\tPremise 760 806\tI could save enormous time in finding solution\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tPremise 808 863\tThis truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues\nT10\tPremise 865 964\tIf I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now\nT11\tClaim 428 538\tthey could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information\nA2\tStance T11 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T11\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T11\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nT12\tPremise 1179 1250\tthey know which company has better welfare or provides better education\nT13\tPremise 1262 1368\ttheir friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies\nT14\tPremise 1370 1474\tIt is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society\nT15\tPremise 1476 1636\tWhen others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process\nT16\tPremise 986 1022\tparents have worked in tens of years\nT17\tPremise 1024 1082\tthey have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\nT18\tClaim 1084 1163\tThey have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children\nA3\tStance T18 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T18\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T18\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T18\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nT19\tClaim 1745 1818\tchoosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision\nA4\tStance T19 Against\nT20\tPremise 1681 1732\tthe condition of job market is completely different\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T19\t\nT21\tPremise 1866 1925\twhen it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly\nR15\tattacks Arg1:T21 Arg2:T19\t\nT22\tPremise 1927 1991\tThe condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash\nT23\tPremise 2001 2071\tthere is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T23\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T19\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Children managing their own money - best way to learn responsibility\n\nOne of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.\nThe first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.\nAnother aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.\nAlthough some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 374 436\tchildren should learn to manage their own money at a young age\nT2\tClaim 647 730\tit is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 528 642\tsociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tPremise 800 877\twhen I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked\nT5\tPremise 879 952\tFirst time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished\nT6\tPremise 954 1019\tI asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me\nT7\tPremise 1021 1076\tI found that I should manage the way that I spend money\nT8\tPremise 1088 1150\tI learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T2\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T2\t\nT9\tPremise 1567 1680\tI had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood\nT10\tPremise 1682 1769\tHe became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money\nT11\tPremise 1771 1901\tHis parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless\nT12\tPremise 1903 2011\tFinally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died\nT13\tPremise 2013 2109\tNot only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family\nT14\tClaim 1352 1545\tEven in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity\nA2\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1243 1350\tIf parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nT16\tClaim 2143 2204\tchildren should be free to spend money to they what they want\nA3\tStance T16 Against\nT17\tMajorClaim 2220 2335\tit is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons\nT18\tClaim 2345 2423\tour personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood\nA4\tStance T18 For\n"}

I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.\nIn spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities.

Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs.

Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. \nSecondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it.

For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity.

{"prompt":"The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy\n\nThe topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.\nFirst and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.\nAnother reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.\nLast but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.\nTo sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 347 414\tI find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power\nT2\tMajorClaim 1593 1699\tnuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages\nT3\tClaim 532 611\tpursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 613 667\tLast century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons\nT5\tPremise 669 774\tIf each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tClaim 821 891\teven civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 905 1061\trecently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area\nT8\tPremise 1063 1161\tThis unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nT9\tClaim 1316 1422\tSafely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1183 1314\twhile generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power\nT11\tPremise 1424 1520\tThis waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\n"}

Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.\nFirst, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting.

Both can improve their future\n\nSome people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. \nOn the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.\nAt the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community.

{"prompt":"Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life\n\nNowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.\nFirst of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.\nSecondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.\nIn conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 468 559\tit is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life\nT2\tClaim 721 773\tit is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 798 878\twhen I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own\nT4\tPremise 880 943\tAt the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book\nT5\tPremise 960 1012\tI spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend\nT6\tPremise 1025 1144\tI finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nT7\tPremise 595 713\twhen children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T2\t\nT8\tClaim 1156 1248\tby taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1264 1387\tif a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him\nT10\tPremise 1389 1473\tTo compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school\nT11\tPremise 1475 1581\tUnder the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tClaim 1598 1699\tto help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can\nA3\tStance T12 For\nT13\tMajorClaim 1733 1834\tto encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life\n"}
{"prompt":"Study at school or get a job?\n\nMany people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.\nFirst of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.\nNevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.\nOverall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 337 381\tstudent have to be forced to study at school\nT2\tMajorClaim 1541 1572\tstudents should study at school\nT3\tClaim 1586 1643\tthere are some advantages of leaving school to find a job\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 1645 1711\tstudying at school is always the best choice for children's future\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 1713 1820\tThere are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tClaim 837 914\tthey have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 941 1027\temployer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 397 508\tschools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying\nT9\tPremise 680 734\tschools provide lots of academic knowledge to students\nT10\tPremise 736 824\tStudents may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences\nT11\tPremise 510 663\tIt creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nT12\tClaim 1094 1151\tchildren should interrupt their school work and get a job\nA3\tStance T12 Against\nT13\tPremise 1153 1195\tWhether children can learn a lot at school\nT14\tPremise 1197 1271\tthere are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT15\tPremise 1286 1339\tchildren can learn social skills when they have a job\nT16\tPremise 1341 1405\tThey can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school\nT17\tPremise 1407 1515\tWorking helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T12\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Technology that widen the gap between rich and poor?\n\nTechnology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.\nIn the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.\nSecondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.\nUndoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.\nIn conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable.

{"prompt":"Teachers lesson vs other sources\n \nThe way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.\nIt is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.\nOn the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators.

{"prompt":"Work in team or independently\n\nNowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.\nOf course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.\nMoreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his\/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his\/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.\nIn conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important.

{"prompt":"Television destroys communication among friends and family\n\nTelevision is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.\nFirst, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.\nSecond, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. \nThird, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. \nTo sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 355 451\tTV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering\nT2\tClaim 465 529\tModern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 548 582\twatching TV take a lot of your day\nA2\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 597 720\tit makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tClaim 730 781\tpeople like having meals while they are watching TV\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tClaim 783 858\tFamilies usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends\nT7\tPremise 872 962\tmy friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights\nT8\tPremise 964 1013\tIt was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema\nA4\tStance T6 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nT9\tPremise 1023 1058\tTV can be one of communication ways\nT10\tPremise 1070 1199\tTV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps\nT11\tPremise 1213 1263\tTeenagers can play games online with their friends\nT12\tClaim 1275 1320\twe can communicate with each other through TV\nA6\tStance T12 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nT13\tMajorClaim 1544 1585\tTV helps you to get connected with people\nT14\tClaim 1334 1397\tTV may take some of your time away from your family and friends\nA7\tStance T14 Against\nT15\tClaim 1402 1470\tit can also make family get together and help to get in conversation\nA8\tStance T15 For\nT16\tClaim 1483 1520\tit's one way of recent communications\nA9\tStance T16 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often make them more complicated\n\nMany people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.\nOf course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. \nNext, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of.

{"prompt":"Fossil fuels will soon be replaced?\n\nAlthough renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.\nFirstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.\nBesides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.\nAdmittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.\nIn conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 163 244\tnew forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal\nT2\tClaim 255 335\tdue to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 337 436\tResearches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford\nT4\tPremise 457 512\tfossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas\nT5\tPremise 527 725\tit is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms\nT6\tPremise 732 844\tthe plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT8\tClaim 939 1006\tthese new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 864 937\tutility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT7\tPremise 1008 1163\tLatest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards\nT10\tPremise 1178 1311\tthe dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams\nT11\tPremise 1313 1377\tThis damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds\nT12\tPremise 1397 1581\tthe accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations\nT13\tPremise 1588 1639\trenewable resources are not as reliable as we think\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T7\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT14\tClaim 1652 1781\tcontemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming\nA4\tStance T14 Against\nT15\tPremise 1783 1875\tthese problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions\nT16\tPremise 1889 1982\twe can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain\nT17\tPremise 1984 2083\tThese improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy\nT18\tPremise 2085 2140\tWith these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable\nR16\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tattacks Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR14\tattacks Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR15\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T14\t\nT19\tMajorClaim 2209 2281\tthere is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T8\t\n"}

{"prompt":"Some people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type\n\nGenerally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.\nFirst of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance \"a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction\". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.\nOn the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.\nTo conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis.

{"prompt":"Working Extended hours should restricted\n\nWorking longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, \"Health is Wealth\". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. \nFirst of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.\nSecondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.\nTo conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 521 634\ta balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours\nT2\tClaim 398 504\tpeople working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1847 2073\tI would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies\nT4\tClaim 2075 2207\tThis will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 775 949\tBy working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick\nT6\tPremise 961 1042\tthey become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons\nT7\tPremise 1044 1223\tThe repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life\nT8\tClaim 691 773\tpeople; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health\nA3\tStance T8 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tPremise 1362 1402\tthey usually remain busy in their office\nT10\tPremise 1406 1462\tthey do not find leisure time for such social activities\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nT11\tPremise 1478 1573\tI would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years\nT12\tPremise 1575 1723\tRecently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries\nT13\tPremise 1725 1827\tHe started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him\nT14\tClaim 1235 1357\tthese workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign\nA4\tStance T14 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Telephones and emails have made personal communication less required\n\nThere are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.\nSecond, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.\nTelephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 217 338\tI personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal\nT2\tClaim 137 215\tCommunication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 500 597\tUnlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address\nT4\tPremise 599 690\tI can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with\nT5\tPremise 838 906\tI can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want\nT6\tPremise 733 822\tIt is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 908 961\tTelephones and email made me feel close to my parents\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tClaim 406 498\ttelephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other\nA2\tStance T8 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tClaim 971 1071\tusing telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1086 1178\tsometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment\nT11\tPremise 1184 1304\twhen I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion\nT12\tPremise 1312 1363\tthese types of communications make me feel personal\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nT13\tMajorClaim 1568 1643\ttelephones and email do not make communication between people less personal\nT14\tClaim 1365 1407\tTelephones and email make me feel personal\nA4\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1416 1464\tI could directly connect with people that I love\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nT16\tPremise 1474 1538\tI could express my personal thought through telephones and email\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Physical exercise\n\nAlthough some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. \nFirst of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: \"Anima sana in corpore sano\", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.\nBesides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. \nLast, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.\nIn the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 147 199\tthe physical education part should not be outweighed\nT2\tClaim 201 350\tPhysical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 2111 2240\tthe more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students\nT4\tClaim 795 938\tif the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation\nA3\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 446 484\thealthy body is basis for healthy soul\nT6\tPremise 486 581\tThere is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises\nT7\tPremise 583 623\tThe more we practice, the better we feel\nT8\tPremise 639 789\tthere is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 949 1027\twhen we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer\nA4\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1042 1147\twhen a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation\nT11\tPremise 1156 1322\tthe school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically\nT12\tPremise 1337 1446\talmost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nT13\tClaim 1470 1554\tfinancial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is\nA5\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1570 1657\tthe money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare\nT15\tPremise 1665 1700\tthe nation is comparatively healthy\nT16\tPremise 1719 1808\tphysically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development\nT17\tPremise 1831 1884\tthe better a person feels, the better his brain works\nT18\tClaim 1897 2007\tputting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society\nT19\tPremise 2018 2065\tit ends up with financially competitive country\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nA2\tStance T18 For\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T18\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T18\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Funding artists\n\nNowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.\nThe main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.\nIn addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.\nAnother reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.\nTo sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1747 1815\tgovernments should help and encourage artists to continue their work\nT2\tClaim 1627 1734\tart is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 517 593\tart helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists\nT4\tPremise 608 772\tmonuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists\nT5\tPremise 783 847\tsome countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue\nT6\tClaim 855 887\tthe governments should help arts\nA3\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 896 962\ttheir work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tClaim 1114 1181\tculture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 977 1101\tsculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1183 1306\tYoung people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT11\tClaim 1363 1423\ttalent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted\nA4\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1433 1503\tnot many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts\nT13\tPremise 1512 1614\tthis type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Mobile phones: faster communication vs social problems\n\nRecently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.\nIn the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.\nFurthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.\nHowever, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. \nTo sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 272 348\tthis great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society\nT2\tClaim 1818 1861\tmobile phones make our communication faster\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tMajorClaim 1863 1962\tit also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health\nT4\tPremise 475 722\tas people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills\nT5\tPremise 734 822\tcontinuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture\nT6\tClaim 837 889\tit is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 370 460\tspending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 992 1085\tthere many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature\nT9\tPremise 1087 1299\tIn these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors\nT10\tPremise 1315 1364\tfrequent conflicts may occur during communication\nT11\tClaim 904 976\tthe growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development\nA3\tStance T11 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nT12\tPremise 1536 1729\tas most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge\nT13\tClaim 1737 1795\tmobile phones have shortened the distance of communication\nA4\tStance T13 Against\nT14\tPremise 1429 1514\tMobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"One long vacation or several long vacation\n\nEverybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.\nFirstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.\nSecondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.\nVacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule.

{"prompt":"People are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time\n\nNowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.\nFirstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.\nIn addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.\nFinally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.\nIn conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 319 349\tcars have improved modern life\nT2\tClaim 2223 2252\tcars cause a lot of pollution\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 2261 2333\tthey provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tMajorClaim 2335 2500\tTravelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car\nT5\tPremise 601 659\tthey can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle\nT6\tClaim 521 592\tMany people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 703 810\tmy car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city\nT8\tPremise 812 892\tI was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away\nT9\tPremise 894 985\tThanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today\nT10\tPremise 987 1071\tWithout my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship\nT11\tPremise 381 489\tpeople are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages\nT12\tPremise 1133 1201\tpeople are able to drive to work and can work further away from home\nT13\tPremise 1216 1238\tthey are more flexible\nT14\tPremise 1240 1342\tMy father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money\nT15\tPremise 1344 1460\tHe used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend\nT16\tPremise 1462 1627\tIf he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms\nT17\tClaim 1086 1124\tcars increase the chance of employment\nA3\tStance T17 For\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T17\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T17\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T17\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T17\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\nT18\tPremise 1638 1718\tthe automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world\nT19\tPremise 1720 1817\tIf people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life\nT20\tPremise 1819 1905\tThey are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas\nT21\tPremise 1907 2045\tThere are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car\nT22\tClaim 2060 2150\tpeople who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world\nA5\tStance T22 For\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T22\t\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T22\t\nR19\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T22\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nA2\tStance T6 For\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T6\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T22\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas?\n\nWhen we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.\nFirst, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.\nEven in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.\nIn fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.\nBased on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T2\tPremise 396 454\tif all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring\nT1\tMajorClaim 315 387\tif the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper\nT3\tPremise 456 530\tIf good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas\nT4\tClaim 924 992\twe can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 532 573\tThen we will feel less interested in them\nT6\tPremise 575 697\tBut if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story\nT7\tPremise 712 798\tHollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl\nT8\tPremise 800 858\tBut now many people, including me, have been tired with it\nT9\tPremise 860 919\tI don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT10\tClaim 1138 1258\tif children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world\nT11\tPremise 1260 1299\tThey will be misleading by those movies\nT12\tPremise 1305 1357\tthey may act like good people in order to get reward\nT13\tPremise 1359 1466\tOnce they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person\nT14\tPremise 1481 1547\tthe good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not\nT15\tPremise 1552 1623\twe should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tPremise 994 1060\tEven in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes\nT17\tPremise 1074 1133\tit happen more often in the real world than in those movies\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T10\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\nA1\tStance T10 For\nT18\tPremise 1634 1674\tthose good endings sometimes are helpful\nT19\tPremise 1676 1723\tSome people may be encouraged to do good things\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nT20\tPremise 1742 1779\tthis kind of behavior won’t last long\nT21\tPremise 1789 1824\tsomeday they will realize the truth\nT22\tClaim 1839 1885\twe should show people the truth in the stories\nA4\tStance T22 For\nT23\tPremise 1891 1957\tif they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T22\t\nR17\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T22\t\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T20\t\nR19\tattacks Arg1:T20 Arg2:T18\t\nT24\tMajorClaim 1996 2098\tmovies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing\n"}
{"prompt":"Learning a foreign language in my own country or another country\n\nKnowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.\nSecondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.\nIn conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 376 433\tGoing to another place to learn language is better choice\nT2\tMajorClaim 1430 1517\tlearning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country\nT3\tClaim 1526 1583\tI have to improve myself to communicate with other people\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 1594 1676\tin foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends\nT5\tMajorClaim 1678 1766\tLearning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language\nT6\tPremise 610 714\teveryone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people\nT7\tPremise 716 810\tIf I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger\nT8\tPremise 812 926\tThis environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language\nT9\tClaim 493 595\tgoing to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tClaim 938 1035\thaving friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1051 1176\tEnglish school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages\nT12\tPremise 1178 1249\tThe only language that I could talk to make friends is English language\nT13\tPremise 1257 1322\tI could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong\nT14\tPremise 1324 1387\tThis reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster\nA5\tStance T4 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"\"Pen and Paper\" Examination\n\nExaminations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.\nThere are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.\nA number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.\nIn conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement.

In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.\nFirst of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.\nNext, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.\nLastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she\/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.\nIn conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well.

{"prompt":"Television has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends\n\nThere are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.\nTo begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show \"Infinete Challenges\". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.\nMoreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 365 398\ttelevision has more bad than good\nT2\tClaim 407 461\tit has made people not to have conversation each other\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 628 708\tthey cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time\nT4\tPremise 540 620\tOne who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air\nT5\tPremise 715 768\tthey think the programs are so crucial to their lives\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tPremise 770 924\tOne of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show \"Infinete Challenges\"\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tPremise 926 1066\tThis is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other\nT8\tPremise 1077 1174\twatching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 478 538\ttelevision shows make people forget what is really important\nA2\tStance T9 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tPremise 1402 1494\tit is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness\nT11\tPremise 1303 1394\tWatching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 1520 1630\tit is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together\nT13\tPremise 1632 1669\tIt is natural they behave in that way\nT14\tPremise 1678 1726\ttelevision shows don't require any participation\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nT15\tClaim 1186 1301\teven when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television\nA3\tStance T15 For\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tMajorClaim 1765 1907\tit is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward\nT17\tClaim 1909 2008\tIt is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close\nA4\tStance T17 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Financial support for sports and social activities\n\nThere are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.\nFirst, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.\nSecond, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.\nMoreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation.

{"prompt":"Financial aid to develop countries\n\nAs is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.\nFirstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.\nIn addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.\nIn conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1598 1656\tfinancial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries\nT2\tClaim 1662 1839\tit has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 979 1121\tthe critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid\nT4\tPremise 492 537\teducation is an essential part in development\nT5\tPremise 553 735\tmost developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities\nT6\tClaim 775 971\tif the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support\nT7\tClaim 1486 1581\tdeveloping countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1213 1358\tsome powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market\nT9\tPremise 1368 1473\tthey rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT10\tMajorClaim 281 366\tit is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries\nA4\tStance T6 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Which do you prefer: do only what you already do well, or not.\n\nYou may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.\nFocusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.\nIf you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.\nIn summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 415 455\tyou should focus on what you are good at\nT2\tMajorClaim 1777 1869\tdoing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better\nT3\tPremise 530 629\tthe more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be\nT4\tPremise 645 819\tAlbert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity\nT5\tPremise 830 866\the hardly cared about something else\nT6\tPremise 868 958\tIt is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup\nT7\tPremise 986 1039\tusing two different soups properly was quite annoying\nT8\tClaim 1073 1160\tyou will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well\nA1\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 457 513\tFocusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT10\tPremise 1236 1324\tWhen you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it\nT11\tPremise 1332 1369\tyou will motivate yourself to do more\nT12\tPremise 1391 1449\tI used to be good at math when I was in junior high school\nT13\tPremise 1459 1522\tI was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably\nT14\tPremise 1524 1593\tI became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nT15\tPremise 1608 1700\tI could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tClaim 1708 1763\tby doing what you are good at, you will be better at it\nA4\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 1162 1234\tIf you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T16\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T16\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should the Government Provide Free College?\n\nSome people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. \nFirst, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. \nSecond, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.\nThird, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. \nIn short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 202 246\tindividuals should pay their college tuition\nT2\tClaim 255 376\tit would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1692 1742\tthe individual should finance his or her education\nT4\tClaim 1787 1848\tit would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the governmen\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 769 852\tit would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds\nT6\tClaim 386 435\tmaking college education free would cost too much\nT7\tPremise 437 535\tIt would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth\nT8\tPremise 537 663\tThere are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools\nT9\tPremise 678 753\tit would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education\nT10\tClaim 1070 1159\tthose people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 863 905\tit is a personal choice to go to a college\nT12\tPremise 907 944\tNot everyone wants to go to a college\nT13\tPremise 946 1057\tPeople who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education\t\nT14\tClaim 1168 1215\tthere are many ways to fund a college education\nA5\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1217 1324\tPeople who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds\nT16\tPremise 1339 1410\tthe government already helps pay college expense through indirect means\nT17\tPremise 1412 1542\tThey often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students\nT18\tPremise 1544 1589\tThey also provide funds for academic research\nT19\tPremise 1591 1679\tWhile the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial\nA6\tStance T6 For\nT20\tClaim 1751 1774\tit is a personal choice\nA3\tStance T20 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T14\t\n"}

The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities.

Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively.

Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.\nOn the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.\nOn the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture.

Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.\nIn conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 317 366\tsome museums and art galleries will not disappear\nT2\tMajorClaim 1469 1568\tmuseums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture\nT3\tClaim 1360 1463\tmodern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 385 440\ttechnology indeed simplifies people's life all the time\nT5\tClaim 453 620\tpeople who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society\nT6\tPremise 631 742\tin accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy\nT7\tPremise 751 812\tthey lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tClaim 833 919\tthe importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tClaim 1260 1330\tthese buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture\nA4\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1190 1247\tmuseums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tPremise 935 1010\tauthentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos\nT12\tPremise 1012 1175\tIt is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nA5\tStance T5 Against\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tattacks Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should we require our young children to learn music and art\n\nEvery parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. \nFirst, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.\nSecond, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.\nHowever, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. \nIn conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his\/her life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 371 421\tchildren should learn music and art in a young age\nT2\tClaim 430 471\tthey do contribute several merits to them\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 2048 2113\tyoung age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art\nT4\tClaim 2204 2299\tMusic and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his\/her life\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 875 977\tthey are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances\nT6\tPremise 819 866\tChildren are privileged to have these abilities\nT7\tClaim 481 567\tit's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young\nT8\tPremise 569 667\tChildren absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination\nT9\tPremise 669 740\tMusic and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules\nT10\tPremise 742 817\tThey are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched\nT11\tPremise 979 1119\tEven if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination\nT12\tClaim 1322 1425\teven if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1129 1188\tmusic and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing\nT14\tPremise 1190 1267\tThey teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way\nT15\tPremise 1269 1309\tThey are essential to our spiritual life\nT16\tPremise 1434 1483\tit can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure\nT17\tClaim 1523 1571\tparents shouldn't put so much stress on children\nA3\tStance T17 Against\nT18\tPremise 1579 1633\tlearning too many skills seems to be a burden for them\nT19\tPremise 1650 1714\tit depends on how you value these learning activities to be like\nT20\tPremise 1716 1842\tIf parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much\nT21\tPremise 1844 1975\tIn a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills\nT22\tPremise 1990 2030\tit will not be such pressure on children\nA6\tStance T7 For\nT23\tClaim 2118 2202\tthey are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage\nA5\tStance T23 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR12\tattacks Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T19\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T22\t\nR15\tattacks Arg1:T22 Arg2:T17\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The opportunity to receive education from university\n\nThere are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. \nWhat is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.\nIn a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life.

{"prompt":"Prepared Food\n\nNowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.\nFirst of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.\nNot cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.\nIn addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.\nIn conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T3\tMajorClaim 193 383\tit is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits\nT4\tClaim 104 183\tit can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society\nA2\tStance T4 Against\nT5\tClaim 911 977\teasy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 501 676\tto make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people\nT7\tPremise 683 736\tingredients being added have caused dire consequences\nT8\tPremise 752 903\tthere are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT9\tClaim 979 1041\tNot cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition\nA4\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1137 1295\tWhereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT1\tClaim 1745 1850\tthe invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nT2\tMajorClaim 1852 1874\tit is not a good thing\nT11\tClaim 1348 1409\tThe more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose\nA5\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1411 1558\tAt the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes\nT13\tPremise 1564 1719\trare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth\n\nIn today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.\nThe first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. \nThe second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.\nIn conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 311 384\tfatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood\nT2\tMajorClaim 1496 1667\tfatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships\nT3\tPremise 502 607\tthe role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics\nT4\tPremise 622 815\tin a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child\nT5\tClaim 386 488\tThe first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage\nA1\tStance T5 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nT6\tPremise 954 1087\twe are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships\nT7\tPremise 1103 1278\ta family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society\nT8\tClaim 818 937\tThe second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today\nA2\tStance T8 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT9\tPremise 1289 1370\tall of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals\nT10\tPremise 1398 1479\thaving and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\n"}
{"prompt":"People are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification\n\nThe career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.\nA full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.\nMoreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named \"Technological Unemployment\". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1716 1890\tpeople are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves\nT2\tClaim 781 890\tpeople are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 580 691\twith the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall\nT4\tPremise 693 766\tThis overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tPremise 468 574\tA full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tClaim 1467 1529\tThe best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 1551 1666\tcorporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors\nT8\tPremise 1425 1465\tmany people's jobs are now at high stake\nT9\tPremise 1239 1418\trobots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1058 1224\tNorth American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one\nT11\tPremise 902 993\tthe arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The gender issue for getting education needs\n\nThe gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.\nThe proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.\nAnother reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.\nIn conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender.

{"prompt":"Saving\/Spending money\n\nIn recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.\nFirst, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.\nIn addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. \nFinally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.\nConsidering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 300 346\tsaving some part of your earnings is essential\nT2\tClaim 368 522\tyou can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 925 1002\tthey had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence\nT4\tPremise 890 920\tThey could not afford the rent\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 766 855\tI remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe\nT6\tClaim 595 753\tThe global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 531 593\tthere are several uncertainties about your professional future\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tClaim 1082 1192\tIt is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1017 1080\tyou can not be sure about the development in your personal life\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1194 1318\tBack in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT11\tPremise 1320 1355\tHe could not afford the maintenance\nT12\tPremise 1359 1376\the had to sell it\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nT13\tClaim 1462 1622\tWorking hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished\nA4\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1388 1460\twith savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tPremise 1638 1725\tI made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend\nT16\tPremise 1727 1792\tWithout our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T13\t\nT17\tMajorClaim 1863 1919\tthere is no other choice than saving money for some time\n"}
{"prompt":"Is image more powerful than the written word?\n\n\"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.\nFirstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.\nLooking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.\nTo conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 378 487\tI agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication\nT2\tMajorClaim 1697 1809\tboth images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words\nT3\tClaim 1105 1200\tit is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 498 541\tpictures can influence the way people think\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 556 661\tnowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking\nT6\tPremise 676 799\tstatistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 816 1007\tthe magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan\nT8\tPremise 1026 1097\timages are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 1236 1307\twritten words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1309 1405\tWith only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images\nT11\tPremise 1420 1499\tthis is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about\nT12\tPremise 1514 1571\tthe primary way of educating students is also by this way\nT13\tPremise 1573 1682\tAcademic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media\n\nAs a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:\nIt is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.\nFirst of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.\nFurthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems.

{"prompt":"Should replace normal classroom with online computer classes?\n\nThere are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.\nSecondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.\nLastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. \nIn conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 389 486\tI completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course\nT2\tClaim 115 155\tit should not replace classroom learning\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 157 218\tLearning in classroom could provide more information to study\nT4\tPremise 229 373\tlearning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tPremise 675 735\tin classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example\nT6\tPremise 750 820\tin biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits\nT7\tPremise 822 887\tLearner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog\nT8\tPremise 907 974\tonline class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation\nT9\tClaim 546 665\tlearning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt\nA2\tStance T9 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tClaim 986 1046\tonline class could not provide knowledge about social skills\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1245 1300\tThis important skill cannot be gotten in online classes\nT12\tPremise 1062 1137\tIn a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group\nT13\tPremise 1139 1243\tThis could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nT14\tPremise 1375 1450\tin school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body\nT15\tPremise 1452 1519\tClassroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way\nT16\tPremise 1521 1582\tIf student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves\nT17\tPremise 1584 1656\tThis make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide\nT18\tClaim 1310 1366\tlearning in classroom, student could have healthier life\nA6\tStance T18 For\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T18\t\nT19\tMajorClaim 1674 1763\tI personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class\nT20\tClaim 2039 2097\thaving classroom could provide abundant skills to students\nA7\tStance T20 For\nT21\tPremise 1774 1867\tclassroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject\nT22\tPremise 1878 1943\tclassroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill\nT23\tPremise 1955 2031\tclassroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health\nR19\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T20\t\nR20\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T20\t\nR21\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T20\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T18\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T18\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T18\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The option to work or study from home is advantage or disadvantage\n\nUndoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.\nOn the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.\nOn the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.\nFollowing both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks.

{"prompt":"Cheap air travel should be encouraged?\n\nIn recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.\nIt is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.\nOn the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. \nIn conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 299 341\tcheap flight can make many serious problem\nT3\tClaim 365 473\tcheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 475 554\tThese days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure\nT2\tPremise 556 679\tThey can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds\nT5\tPremise 691 805\ttravels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tClaim 826 893\tgrowing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 907 1033\tmore flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it\nT8\tPremise 1044 1095\tthe biggest concern is the effect on global warming\nT9\tPremise 1097 1191\tBurning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up\nT10\tPremise 1202 1328\twhile many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nT11\tMajorClaim 1365 1419\tthe drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits\n"}
{"prompt":"Human activities are harming the Earth\n\n\"Save the planet Earth\" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.\nFirstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.\nSecondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.\nLastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.\nTo conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected.

{"prompt":"Citizen's only responsibility is to pay taxes\n\nThere is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.\nTaxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.\nSome people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.\nTaking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes.

{"prompt":"Internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines\n\nDigital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.\nA very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.\nPeople often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.\nTo conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 423 477\tnewspapers and magazines will be history with the time\nT2\tClaim 521 632\tinternet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 852 953\twhen the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident\nT4\tPremise 955 1036\tThe friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth\nT5\tPremise 1038 1123\tIn such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media\nT6\tPremise 1125 1268\tInstead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two\nT7\tClaim 1288 1336\tdigital media will rule over paper and magazines\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 634 782\tA very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis\nT9\tPremise 784 837\tThis helps readers to get updated and act accordingly\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT10\tPremise 1467 1583\tone research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War\nT11\tPremise 1585 1718\tIt is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at\nT12\tPremise 1724 1818\tinternet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details\nT13\tClaim 1338 1452\tPeople often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc\nA3\tStance T13 For\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nT14\tPremise 1820 1894\tThis feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tMajorClaim 1909 2040\tthe fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider\nT16\tClaim 2067 2176\tconsidering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years\nA4\tStance T16 Against\n"}
{"prompt":"Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in Rush Hour\n\nStarted in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. \nCapitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.\nBuying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.\nRather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. \nIn conclusion, \"rush hours\" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 470 517\tno additional payment should be charged on them\nT2\tMajorClaim 2347 2425\tcharging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational\nT3\tClaim 2196 2258\t\"rush hours\" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 791 856\tcharging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 552 652\tCapitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them\nT6\tPremise 654 772\tDriving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so\nT7\tPremise 886 956\ttraffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban\nT8\tPremise 961 990\tit is out of drivers' control\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tPremise 1076 1170\tWars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT10\tClaim 1327 1389\tCharging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT12\tPremise 1172 1325\tBuying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear\nT11\tPremise 1471 1566\tcharging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights\nT13\tPremise 1391 1465\tMajority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT14\tPremise 1857 1973\tSometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways\nT15\tPremise 1991 2064\tthe one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers\nT16\tClaim 2078 2178\tcharging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful\nA4\tStance T16 For\nT17\tClaim 1568 1855\tRather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil\nA5\tStance T17 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Universities require students to study many subjects or specialize in one subject\n\nUniversity is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.\nFirst of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.\nIn addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.\nFinally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.\nIn concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 328 369\tstudying many subjects is better that one\nT2\tClaim 378 531\tstudents can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1831 1913\tlearning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject\nT4\tClaim 1922 2039\tit makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 547 677\twhen students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities\nT6\tPremise 695 757\tthey interested in many subjects and they want to try them all\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 772 832\tpupil who want to study science are also like to learn music\nT8\tClaim 845 906\trequiring students to study in many subjects is good for them\nA3\tStance T8 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tPremise 1292 1347\tthey all can share opinion and knowledge to one another\nT10\tClaim 921 992\tpeople who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one\nA5\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 994 1064\tStudents can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study\nT12\tPremise 1080 1153\tuniversity students who study business are also know history of the world\nT13\tPremise 1168 1235\tstudents not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience\nT14\tPremise 1244 1283\tthey will meet new friends and teachers\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nT15\tClaim 1358 1517\tstudents who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career\nA4\tStance T15 For\nT16\tPremise 1535 1618\tgraduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer\nT17\tPremise 1633 1720\tstudents will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nT18\tPremise 1732 1814\tbachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Gossip-based information\n\nNowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: \"information is power\". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.\nThe first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.\nSecondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the \"salt-panic\" was over. \nTo conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 166 186\tinformation is power\nT2\tClaim 329 403\tby using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability\nT3\tPremise 405 541\tSome people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information\nT4\tPremise 556 714\tRussian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia\nT5\tPremise 716 833\tAfter a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia\nA1\tStance T2 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tMajorClaim 1662 1804\tit is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence\nT7\tClaim 1096 1184\tyou have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1186 1225\tIt is possible to make a wrong decision\nT9\tPremise 1234 1333\tyou have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong\nT10\tPremise 1348 1499\tseveral years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops\nT11\tPremise 1501 1627\tThe gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the \"salt-panic\" was over\nT12\tPremise 845 930\tit is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations\nT13\tPremise 940 995\tit can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Gun control \n\nGun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.\nThe first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.\nSecondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.\nThirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.\nIn conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 282 323\tit is sensible to enforce the gun control\nT2\tMajorClaim 1577 1702\tthe guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence\nT3\tClaim 1483 1560\tconsidering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 730 848\tmost violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 862 919\tguns will create a violent society if the trend continues\nT6\tPremise 938 1058\tin American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting\nT7\tPremise 1075 1192\tsome terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tClaim 599 718\tthe fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates\nA4\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 389 491\tThe accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 506 594\twe hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT11\tClaim 1203 1261\tthe possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide\nA5\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1263 1357\tIn the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent\nT13\tPremise 1374 1466\tthere is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What's more important: hard work or luck?\n\nWhat do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. \nTo begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man\/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.\nMoreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.\nFinally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his\/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.\nIn the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2023 2071\tany great success need great work not great luck\nT2\tClaim 2085 2120\tluck is one factor in reaching goal\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 2125 2193\tits impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tPremise 1012 1063\tHe do a lot of exercise in football field every day\nT5\tPremise 1068 1109\tit is not for which he is luckier than me\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nT6\tClaim 449 507\tfamous people are usually diligent people not lucky people\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 509 589\tHard work make you a professional man\/woman which are powerful in his or her job\nT8\tPremise 599 664\twhen you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT9\tPremise 678 751\tin football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal\nT10\tPremise 753 803\tStatically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty\nT11\tPremise 805 886\tBut I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me\nT12\tPremise 888 939\tIt is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me\nT13\tPremise 941 1010\tDefinitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tPremise 1554 1616\tit is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam\nT15\tPremise 1481 1540\tIf you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nT16\tPremise 1385 1479\tYou cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky\nT17\tPremise 1282 1383\tyou prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nT18\tClaim 1121 1171\twe cannot always lean on our luck to be successful\nA4\tStance T18 For\nT19\tPremise 1173 1264\tI don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T18\t\nT20\tClaim 1726 1844\tThe most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance\nA3\tStance T20 For\nT21\tPremise 1627 1724\tyou have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way\nT22\tPremise 1846 1908\tThese plans is done by someone who is mastered in his\/her work\nT23\tPremise 1922 2001\tsuch people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T20\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T20\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T20\t\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits\n\nAdvertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.\nFirst of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. \nSecond, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. \nIn conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 480 544\tthe advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits\nT2\tMajorClaim 2018 2082\tadvertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits\nT3\tClaim 2196 2310\tadvertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT5\tPremise 623 727\tThe key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control\nT6\tPremise 745 869\tadvertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body\nT7\tPremise 880 937\tadvertising is not the only information source for people\nT8\tPremise 939 1039\tPeople can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines\nT9\tPremise 1041 1226\tAs long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations\nT10\tPremise 1228 1380\tIt will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors\nT11\tClaim 560 621\tadvertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit\nA3\tStance T11 For\nT12\tClaim 1571 1635\tadvertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1391 1553\tin the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods\nT14\tPremise 1637 1809\tThink about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added\nT15\tPremise 1811 1900\tThese are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good\nT16\tPremise 1918 2000\tthe advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle\nT4\tClaim 2084 2185\tThere are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter\nA2\tStance T4 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T11\t\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T6 Arg2:T11\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"One important thing that I want to change about my hometown\n\nPublic utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. \nAt first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. \nSecondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.\nLastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive.

{"prompt":"Computers have made life easier\n\nThe advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. \nFirst, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. \nSecond, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. \nFinally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 332 386\tcomputers brought convenience and easiness to our life\nT2\tClaim 393 479\tthey enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 1018 1127\twith the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources\nT4\tPremise 555 686\tThrough computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed\nT5\tPremise 688 846\tSearch engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes\nT6\tPremise 848 1009\tSocial networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments\nT7\tClaim 489 553\tcomputers through internet made our access to information easier\nA3\tStance T7 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 1138 1229\tin a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper\nT9\tPremise 1231 1336\tWith the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes\nT10\tPremise 1351 1367\tit is convenient\nT11\tPremise 1376 1572\tyou do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 1574 1647\tInternet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible\nT13\tPremise 1662 1807\tvia skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tClaim 1820 1871\tcommunication has become cheaper, faster and visual\nA5\tStance T14 For\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T14\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nT15\tMajorClaim 1898 1949\tcomputers have made life easier and more convenient\nT16\tClaim 1967 2102\tit broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways\nA6\tStance T16 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Computer has negative effects to children\n\nNowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.\nFirst, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.\nMoreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.\nFinally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.\nIn conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children.

{"prompt":"Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless\n\nUnemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.\nGovernment money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.\nAlso, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.\nOf course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.\nIn conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 189 291\tit is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out\nT2\tClaim 1454 1517\tthe government should provide help for the disadvantaged people\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tMajorClaim 1519 1633\tdirect financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity\nT4\tClaim 293 362\tGovernment money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 364 409\tTax revenue is collected from those who works\nT6\tPremise 411 509\tSpending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers\nT7\tPremise 520 625\tthere are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education\nT8\tPremise 630 678\taddressing unemployment should have low priority\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 706 790\tto survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 792 907\tIf they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tPremise 1315 1402\tit is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again\nT12\tClaim 920 989\tthis does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance\nA5\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 991 1128\tThey are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support\nT14\tPremise 1144 1302\tthe government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\n"}

{"prompt":"Should University education be free for everyone interested?\n\nA famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.\nUniversity is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.\nMoreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies.

The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.\nTherefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education.

{"prompt":"Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects\n\nIn today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.\nThe best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.\nNowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.\nFollowing the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 343 506\tcomputer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers\nA1\tStance T1 For\nT2\tMajorClaim 197 304\tIt is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis\nT3\tMajorClaim 1822 1852\tcomputer is a boon to children\nT4\tClaim 1043 1087\tcomputer impacts children on a positive note\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 642 770\tthrough computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about\nT6\tPremise 508 637\tThe best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything\nT7\tPremise 787 935\tstudents preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter\nT8\tPremise 937 1028\tIt's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers\nT9\tClaim 1594 1656\tit's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1099 1231\tcomputers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way\nT11\tPremise 1233 1418\tWhen children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world\nT12\tPremise 1434 1581\tstudents who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Challenges are different from generation to generation\n\nWhile debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.\nFirst, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. \nSecond, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want.

{"prompt":"High sales reflect power of advertising and not the real need\n\nNowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.\nTo boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product.

{"prompt":"Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?\n\nIt is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.\nFirst of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.\nOn the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.\nConsequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 503 575\twe should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education\nT2\tMajorClaim 2154 2231\ta more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success\nT3\tClaim 591 714\tthrough cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 716 851\tWhat we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others\nT5\tPremise 853 1086\tDuring the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred\nT6\tPremise 1088 1191\tAll of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 1332 1376\tcompetition makes the society more effective\nA2\tStance T7 Against\nT8\tPremise 1212 1301\tthe significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory\nT9\tPremise 1387 1492\twhen we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation\nT10\tPremise 1549 1846\tTake Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care\nT11\tClaim 1927 1992\twithout the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition\nA3\tStance T11 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you believe that elderly people used to live in a better world?\n\nChanges are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.\nWe live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. \nThe phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.\nIn conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 1980 2043\tthe people from older generation may claim they had better life\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nT2\tPremise 2047 2107\tthere were stronger bonds between family members and friends\nT3\tMajorClaim 2269 2395\tin the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically\nT4\tPremise 2139 2199\tthey judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T1\t\nT5\tClaim 460 585\tWe live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 587 663\tA clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones\nT7\tPremise 665 803\tThe strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 976 1190\tsocial networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago\nT9\tPremise 815 952\tsome people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication\nR4\tattacks Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tPremise 1193 1361\tThe phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in\nT11\tPremise 1370 1561\teven some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists\nT12\tPremise 1563 1644\tThe advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives\nT13\tPremise 1662 1783\tscientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough\nT14\tClaim 1797 1951\tthe increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine\nA4\tStance T14 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\n"}

Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.\nTaking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives.

{"prompt":"Artists' freedom to express ideas\n\nArtists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.\nFirst and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.\nFurthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.\nLooking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.\nTo conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 301 394\tthe artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece\nT2\tMajorClaim 2217 2270\tthere should not be any restrictions on artists' work\nT3\tClaim 2515 2594\tthere are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tMajorClaim 2624 2663\tthere should be no restrictions on them\nT5\tPremise 2272 2353\tAllowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves\nT6\tPremise 2357 2411\tideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations\nT7\tPremise 2420 2488\teven though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tClaim 844 923\twithout any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 416 524\tif there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run\nT10\tPremise 548 707\twhen they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies\nT11\tPremise 722 832\tpaintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tPremise 938 1070\tit is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation\nT13\tClaim 1486 1570\thuman rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely\nA5\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1072 1158\tToday, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries\nT15\tPremise 1160 1277\tArts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country\nT16\tPremise 1307 1478\tthe famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T13\t\nT17\tClaim 1865 2019\tIn case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society\nA6\tStance T17 Against\nT18\tPremise 2049 2179\tartists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts\nT19\tPremise 1665 1748\tThey might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country\nT20\tPremise 1770 1863\tMalaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T17\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17\t\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity\n\nThe city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. \nHistoric buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. \nFurthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. \nMeanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. \nOverall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity.

{"prompt":"Benefits of students doing extra jobs\n\nIn present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.\nIt is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.\nSecondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.\nLastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.\nIn conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1977 2064\thaving a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits\nT2\tClaim 2066 2210\tBy taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 394 500\tIt is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs\nT4\tClaim 856 993\thaving experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation\nA3\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 751 844\tstudents who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience\nT6\tPremise 622 736\tthat seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 502 607\tPart-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tClaim 1005 1098\tstudents who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1100 1290\tBy constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained\nT10\tPremise 1298 1495\tworking conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT11\tClaim 1505 1570\tdoing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation\nA4\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1580 1683\thigh studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students\nT13\tPremise 1685 1799\tWith the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nT14\tClaim 1811 1940\tthat helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life\nA5\tStance T14 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Distance-learning cannot bring the benefits that traditional colleges offer\n \nWith the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.\nTo begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.\nBesides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.\nIt is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.\nIn conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 379 439\tstudents can acquire more benefits from the remote education\nT2\tClaim 1740 1852\ttraditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tMajorClaim 1863 2059\tdistance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose\nT4\tClaim 456 527\tstudying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 529 679\tStudents who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection\nT6\tPremise 681 846\tThis especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT7\tPremise 1237 1322\the can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course\nT8\tPremise 1137 1233\tA student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tClaim 862 998\tlong-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1000 1135\tPupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tClaim 1346 1460\ttraditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations\nA4\tStance T11 Against\nT12\tPremise 1462 1568\tThese make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities\nT13\tPremise 1574 1708\twith the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do zoos serve any useful function?\n\nIt has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.\nSome people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.\nOn the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.\nFrom my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1323 1512\tIn modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers\nT2\tClaim 1523 1720\trecently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 480 524\tzoos are fascinating places of entertainment\nT4\tPremise 562 689\tthe very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 713 748\tall zoos serve relates to education\nT6\tPremise 750 859\tMany students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world\nT7\tPremise 871 956\tsome zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tClaim 428 464\thumanities benefit so much from zoos\nA2\tStance T8 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tClaim 1019 1057\tzoos just take away freedom of animals\nA3\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 1059 1160\tBeing confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented\nT11\tPremise 1180 1268\tzoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Jury must have access to criminals' past records\n\nCourts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.\nMany people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.\nNevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.\nIn conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict.

{"prompt":"Universities should give money to sport activities or libraries\n\nLibraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.\nFirst, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.\nSecond, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.\nLast but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.\nIn spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important.

{"prompt":"Email and text messaging threats written language\n\nThe introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.\nFirst of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.\nThe popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts.

{"prompt":"Testing on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions\n\nPerhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.\nThere are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.\nSecondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.\nThere is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 339 391\tprimates should have the same rights as human beings\nT2\tMajorClaim 1708 1733\tit should be made illegal\nT3\tClaim 1631 1689\tit seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 393 454\tThere are several reasons why animal testing should be banned\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 465 496\tthe costs outweigh the benefits\nT6\tPremise 498 633\tEvery year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result\nT7\tPremise 635 683\tAnimal testing costs an enormous amount of money\nT8\tPremise 691 768\tthey must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 1150 1206\tsacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 780 820\tanimals are kept in unnatural conditions\nT11\tPremise 822 935\tRecent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs\nT12\tPremise 937 1121\tIn March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT13\tPremise 1422 1478\tanimals and people's response to a drug can be different\nT14\tClaim 1506 1596\thuman beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual\nT15\tPremise 1335 1414\tit is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T15\t\nA4\tStance T14 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the phone\n\nNowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. \nFirst and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.\nAnother important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.\nAnother technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. \nTo sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life.

{"prompt":"Classroom learnng vs online education\n\nThere are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.\nFirst, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.\nSecond, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.\nThird, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.\nIt's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. \nFrom the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 277 331\tonline classes should never replace classroom learning\nT2\tMajorClaim 2063 2140\tthe classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons\nT3\tPremise 462 525\tIn the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates\nT4\tPremise 535 652\tif you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 667 858\tWhen I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects\nT6\tPremise 868 896\tI got 1st rank in final exam\nT7\tClaim 377 460\tclassroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes\nA1\tStance T7 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tClaim 969 1015\tIt makes you perfect in time management skills\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 906 967\tin classroom learning you have to complete study work on time\nT10\tPremise 1026 1104\tyou can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others\nT11\tPremise 1106 1217\tIt makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tClaim 1522 1539\tyou learn quickly\nA3\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1226 1390\tprofessors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills\nT14\tPremise 1392 1510\tYou can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT15\tPremise 1585 1833\tFor Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nT16\tClaim 1856 1930\tonline classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary\nA4\tStance T16 Against\nT18\tPremise 1936 1995\tthey could not be substitute of existing classroom learning\nR11\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm against providing more money to professors\n\nUniversity education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. \nTo begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.\nBesides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. \nAt school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 358 481\tMoney should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors\nT2\tClaim 277 305\tThe professors are essential\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 316 356\tthe schools are established for students\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tPremise 609 699\tthe most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively\nT5\tPremise 701 798\tBy renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment\nT6\tPremise 800 859\tA comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer\nT7\tPremise 867 940\tstudents spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 958 1024\tstudents have a better environment to working on their assignments\nT9\tPremise 1028 1073\tthe quality of their assignments will improve\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tPremise 1081 1143\tthe competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T5\t\nT11\tPremise 1145 1217\tIn my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby\nT12\tPremise 1227 1312\tI prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment\nT13\tPremise 1314 1347\tIt's unpleasant to stay at school\nT14\tPremise 1358 1445\tcoffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly\nT15\tClaim 530 599\tthe school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors\nA2\tStance T15 For\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T15\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T15\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T15\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tClaim 1526 1612\tTo improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate\nA3\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 1456 1524\tthe ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nT18\tPremise 1777 1857\tHigh-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tPremise 1859 1902\tThere won't be any effect if school does so\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T16\t\nT20\tPremise 1904 1965\tThere was news about raising professors' salary in my country\nT21\tPremise 1967 2031\tThis event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly\nT22\tPremise 2033 2103\tThe proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries\nT23\tPremise 2121 2202\tif the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T23\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T23\t\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T23\t\nR19\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T16\t\nT24\tMajorClaim 2365 2409\tI against providing more money to professors\nT25\tClaim 2239 2340\tStudents' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university\nA5\tStance T25 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Rush vs Slower Pace\n\nModern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.\nFirst, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.\nIn addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.\nFinally, quality takes time.

{"prompt":"Nowadays, spending budget on space exploration is not reasonable\n\nSpace exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. \nMany governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. \nSpace exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union.

As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.\nIn summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity.

{"prompt":"Distance-learning vs. attending school in person\n\nA matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.\nTo begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.\nNevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.\nBy way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 364 506\tonline-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions\nT2\tMajorClaim 1814 1910\tdistance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases\nT3\tClaim 1049 1137\teducational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 523 613\tdistance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 615 803\tIn earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation\nT6\tPremise 805 929\tNow, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT7\tPremise 944 1033\tthe presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tPremise 1139 1352\tThanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 1413 1524\tattending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates\nA3\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 1526 1676\tThey further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life\nT11\tPremise 1678 1769\tIt is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\n"}

But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. \nThere are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.\nTelevision and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.\nTelevision and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body.

Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.\nIt is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.\nAnother debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.\nMoreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.\nIn conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects.

They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.\nIn addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology.

{"prompt":"Human needs vs saving land for endangered animals\n\nIn the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.\nFirst, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.\nIn addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.\nIn conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 394 456\twe clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment\nT2\tMajorClaim 1809 1966\twe definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions\nT3\tPremise 557 660\tIf we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet\nT4\tPremise 662 795\tAs we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem\nT5\tPremise 812 913\tevery day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland\nT6\tPremise 915 1044\tIf we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct\nT7\tPremise 1059 1141\tfurther generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tClaim 492 555\tthe natural diversity is very important for further generations\nA2\tStance T8 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tPremise 1223 1356\tOur behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming\nT10\tPremise 1358 1423\tThis not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans\nT11\tPremise 1432 1500\twe are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes\nT12\tPremise 1515 1651\trecent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average\nT13\tPremise 1653 1743\tThis will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate\nT14\tClaim 1156 1221\ta stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather\nA1\tStance T14 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T14\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Is it necessary to teach children handwriting?\n\nIn this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.\nDespite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.\nSecondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance.

{"prompt":"Technology helps student learn more information and learn more quickly?\n\nNowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.\nTo start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.\nAnother point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.\nOn balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 274 386\tthe richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress\nT2\tClaim 1429 1502\tit expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1369 1424\tI have to consent to the use of technology in education\nT4\tClaim 409 532\ttechnology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 534 655\tThe internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields\nT6\tPremise 657 800\tThere, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide\nT7\tPremise 1089 1141\tstudents will develop their skills at a greater pace\nT8\tPremise 894 1076\tThe modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime\nT9\tPremise 1153 1355\tthe internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly\nT10\tClaim 802 892\tAnother point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning\nA4\tStance T10 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system\n\nSome people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.\nFirstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.\nSecondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.\nMany parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.\nOn the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 267 303\tthese taxes are absolutely essential\nT2\tClaim 314 435\tby paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 453 541\tmany poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course\nT4\tPremise 543 729\tWith the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tPremise 863 925\tthis reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation\nT6\tPremise 938 1038\tthe government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 1053 1237\tthe government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care\nT8\tClaim 741 850\tthe tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital\nA2\tStance T8 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tMajorClaim 1662 1791\ttaxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in\nT10\tClaim 1304 1341\tsuch tax payments are unfair for them\nA3\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tPremise 1363 1432\tit is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use\nT12\tPremise 1448 1561\twe also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade\nT13\tPremise 1563 1628\tWe certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\n"}

In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going.

Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.\nIn conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern.

{"prompt":"Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than complicated\n\nBelieve it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.\nFirst, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.\nSecond, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.\nAdmittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. \nBased on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 366 399\tthe convenience it brings is more\nT2\tClaim 303 364\ttechnology may make people's life complicated in some aspects\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 591 684\tWith a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle\nT4\tPremise 701 846\tif you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times\nT5\tClaim 461 589\twhen it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 896 1050\tIn the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers\nT7\tPremise 1052 1147\tWith the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards\nT8\tPremise 1163 1295\tall the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once\nT9\tClaim 856 894\ttechnology also makes teaching simpler\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1390 1559\tthe cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications\nT11\tPremise 1575 1691\tfolks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them\nT12\tPremise 1706 1837\tgames on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones\nT13\tPremise 1853 1897\tmaking their life more complicated and tired\nT14\tClaim 1325 1375\ttechnology may make people's life more complicated\nT15\tClaim 1985 2044\ttechnology may make people's life complicated in some cases\nA6\tStance T15 Against\nT16\tMajorClaim 2046 2099\tthe convenience it brings in people's are significant\nA5\tStance T14 Against\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should high school make music lessons compulsory\n\nMost people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.\nIt is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.\nBy contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.\nIn conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character.

{"prompt":"More important to work quickly and risk making mistakes\n\nOrganizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.\nTo begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.\nMost importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.\nLast but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.\nTo sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 357 517\tTrying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice\nA1\tStance T1 For\nT2\tMajorClaim 227 281\tWorking fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal\nT3\tMajorClaim 1955 1996\tpeople should work faster even more risky\nT4\tClaim 1998 2135\tGaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 596 722\tAttending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter\nT6\tPremise 724 827\tIf people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace\nT7\tPremise 842 883\tI have a friend who was working so slowly\nT8\tPremise 885 945\tHe has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him\nT9\tPremise 947 1036\tMy friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working\nT10\tClaim 534 594\tif persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1151 1218\tIf they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money\nT12\tPremise 1220 1267\tThis fact pushes them to work faster and faster\nT13\tPremise 1290 1335\tapplying to study abroad needs a lot of money\nT14\tPremise 1337 1389\tI am working in two organization to gain more salary\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nT15\tClaim 1056 1108\tpeople prone to work in two or three firms in a week\nT16\tPremise 1117 1149\tthe expenses have been increased\nA5\tStance T15 For\nT17\tPremise 1391 1423\tThe more money, the more chances\nT18\tPremise 1501 1634\tIf you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks\nT19\tPremise 1636 1729\tIf you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder\nT20\tPremise 1731 1799\tIt turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation\nT21\tPremise 1801 1893\tEven if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money\nT22\tClaim 1445 1499\tpeople who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks\nA4\tStance T22 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T15\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T22\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T22\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T22\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T22\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The best way to relax is by exercises\n\nIn modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.\nIt is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.\nSports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings.

{"prompt":"The precondition of doing research by professors\n\nNowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.\nTo begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.\nOn the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.\nNevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.\nConsequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2528 2611\tProfessors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way\nT2\tClaim 2462 2526\tOnly by developing students, can we have a better academic field\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 2296 2369\tconducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent\nT4\tPremise 2380 2460\tthe precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental\nT5\tClaim 213 257\tthe research takes up too much teaching time\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 146 211\tresearch could bring funding and latest achievements in the field\nT7\tMajorClaim 285 353\tprofessors should spend more time on preparing courses than research\nT8\tPremise 387 441\tprofessors should assist students to acquire knowledge\nT9\tClaim 1582 1643\tprofessors could teach students through research and projects\nA3\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tClaim 2234 2280\tprofessor should concern about preparing class\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tClaim 908 998\tprofessors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research\nA5\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 443 517\tThe professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses\nT13\tPremise 519 661\tIf professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes\nT14\tPremise 663 757\tThe reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies\nT15\tPremise 772 895\tprofessors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students\nT16\tPremise 1019 1158\tif professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities\nT17\tPremise 1160 1259\tStudents are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline\nT18\tPremise 1261 1328\tMany students would not choose these kinds of universities to study\nT19\tPremise 1343 1402\thardly can professors find assistants to help with projects\nT20\tClaim 1460 1566\tspending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research\nA6\tStance T20 For\nT21\tPremise 1645 1693\tSome students enjoy taking part in some research\nT22\tPremise 1695 1806\tThrough to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research\nT23\tPremise 1822 1911\telectronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car\nT24\tPremise 1913 1968\tThey can manage the electric theory in practical skills\nT25\tPremise 1970 2032\tAnd some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions\nT26\tPremise 2043 2159\tonly under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research\nT27\tPremise 2161 2217\tThis is requires professors provide high quality courses\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T11\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T20\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T20\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T20\t\nT28\tPremise 1404 1445\tIt is adverse to the whole academic field\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T28 Arg2:T20\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T28\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T9\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T9\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T22\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T24 Arg2:T22\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T25 Arg2:T22\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T26 Arg2:T10\t\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T27 Arg2:T10\t\nR19\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR20\tattacks Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it\n\nNowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.\nFirst, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. \nSecond, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.\nThird, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.\nIn conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2247 2306\tparents should encourage students to take the part-time job\nT2\tMajorClaim 217 282\tit is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs\nT3\tClaim 2139 2234\ttaking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 436 483\tmost people they contact with are also students\nT5\tClaim 601 653\tthey can teach students many things about adult life\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 335 426\tthere are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 494 595\twhen students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tPremise 655 742\tMy friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it\nT9\tPremise 744 873\tThrough part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life\nT10\tPremise 888 1058\tLisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work\nT11\tPremise 1067 1177\tthanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nT12\tPremise 1287 1310\twe do not experience it\nT13\tPremise 1312 1386\tit is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nT14\tClaim 1399 1468\twe need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nA3\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1480 1738\tsome questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job\nT16\tClaim 1751 1814\tthe part-time job can make people understand future life better\nA4\tStance T16 For\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\nT17\tPremise 1188 1268\tparents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nT18\tClaim 1852 1896\tthe part-time job will effect student' study\nA5\tStance T18 Against\nT19\tPremise 1908 1964\tmost students will do the part-time job in their holiday\nT20\tPremise 1969 2002\tit will not effect on their study\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T20\t\nR13\tattacks Arg1:T20 Arg2:T18\t\nT21\tPremise 2004 2122\tCompared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T20\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Some important characteristics of a co-worker\n\nAt work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.\nThe co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.\nThe co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. \nFinally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 2103 2146\tthe co-workers should believe in fellowship\nT2\tPremise 2148 2241\tThis helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships\nT3\tPremise 2254 2290\tyou spend most of your day at office\nT4\tPremise 2292 2356\tIf you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing\t\nT5\tMajorClaim 446 566\ta good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship\nT6\tPremise 568 621\tThe co-workers should be cooperative with one another\nT7\tClaim 1500 1539\tThe co-workers need to trust each other\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 623 679\tIf they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes\nT9\tPremise 1541 1573\tThey should not act on suspicion\nT10\tPremise 744 854\the always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not\nT11\tPremise 681 732\tI once had a co-worker who was too family conscious\nT12\tPremise 856 992\tMost of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person\nT13\tPremise 1003 1081\tone day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor\nT14\tPremise 1083 1208\tWhen I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse\nT15\tPremise 1210 1377\tFrom that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility\nT16\tClaim 1400 1498\tif the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment\nA4\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 1575 1630\tThis is a very important aspect in the work environment\nT18\tPremise 1632 1750\tI came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me\nT19\tPremise 1752 1868\tTo a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him\nT20\tPremise 1878 1992\tI never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me\nT21\tPremise 1994 2091\tBut this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department\nA2\tStance T1 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T16\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T16\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T16\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T16\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T16\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T16\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T7\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T7\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T7\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T7\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T7\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T1\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T1\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Increased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars?\n\nThere is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.\nOne can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.\nHowever, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.\nAnother point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.\nTo summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 302 430\tWhile many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion\nT2\tMajorClaim 1651 1818\tit disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars\nT3\tClaim 1587 1640\thigher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tClaim 557 692\tTaxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries\nA2\tStance T4 Against\nT5\tPremise 463 555\tif petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 708 837\tfor those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT7\tPremise 936 1034\tthe more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable\nT8\tClaim 1050 1165\tpeople have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 848 919\ttaxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1319 1464\tSuppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them\nT11\tPremise 1466 1571\tAmerica, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil\nT12\tClaim 1218 1317\tcountries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially\nA4\tStance T12 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\n"}

For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.\nSecondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself.

{"prompt":"Government budget focus, young children or university?\n\n\"Education is the investment in our future\", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.\nConcerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.\nThat's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.\nFrom reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 468 539\ta government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both\nT2\tMajorClaim 1909 1993\ta government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities\nT3\tClaim 1995 2043\tboth are crucial on the way to a brighter future\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 960 1167\tif countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 776 942\ta lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development\nT6\tPremise 557 687\telementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society\nT7\tPremise 689 771\tgovernment should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tClaim 1687 1840\tgovernment's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1605 1672\tResearches into humanities and art still need large amount of money\nT10\tPremise 1188 1331\tfor higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance\nT11\tPremise 1333 1487\tThe high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community\nT12\tPremise 1489 1573\tSome may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention\nT13\tPremise 1579 1603\tthis argument is invalid\nR4\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Several languages are in danger of extinction\n\nIt is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.\nFirst and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.\nOn the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.\nIn a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1582 1649\tall languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible\nT2\tPremise 419 529\tit is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country\nT3\tClaim 715 857\tGovernments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 531 604\tIt helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country\nT5\tPremise 606 713\tThe clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist\nT6\tPremise 873 983\tit is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 1004 1059\tthere are some drawbacks from saving minority languages\nA1\tStance T7 Against\nT8\tPremise 1070 1145\tgovernments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tPremise 1168 1274\tthere are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those\nT10\tPremise 1276 1336\tThese kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular\nT11\tPremise 1351 1463\tthe preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre\nT12\tPremise 1465 1545\tIf they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T7\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Serious or entertaining movies\n\nI prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. \nFirst, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.\nSecond, not all of serious movies are boring. \"Click\" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.\nMoreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. \"Blood diamond\", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.\nFor the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 32 99\tI prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful\nT3\tClaim 130 180\tmost serious movies have a wide variety of content\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 182 229\tEntertaining movies are created to amuse people\nT5\tPremise 240 290\tmost entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical\nT6\tPremise 292 384\tCompared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful\nT7\tClaim 877 986\tthe hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 578 721\t\"Click\" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses\nT9\tPremise 723 869\tThe movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT10\tPremise 386 472\tSerious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness\nT11\tPremise 484 530\tit may point out the dark sides of the society\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T3\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T3\t\nT12\tPremise 998 1076\tsome of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world\nT13\tPremise 1078 1191\t\"Blood diamond\", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict\nT14\tPremise 1193 1265\tAfter watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death\nT2\tPremise 1267 1371\tDiamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality\nT15\tClaim 1386 1448\tserious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way\nA4\tStance T15 For\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T15\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tMajorClaim 1473 1570\tI prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\n"}
{"prompt":"There will be soon no role for teachers in classrooms\n\nIn recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.\nThere are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.\nSecondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.\nIn conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 171 294\tI do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers\nT2\tMajorClaim 1627 1667\tthere can be no school without a teacher\nT3\tMajorClaim 1682 1790\tcomputers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place\nT4\tClaim 1792 1862\tTeachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs\nA1\tStance T4 For\nT5\tClaim 381 420\tcomputers need to be operated by people\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 867 951\tthey are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch\nT7\tPremise 671 785\tscientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching\nT8\tPremise 520 660\tlessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector\nT9\tPremise 422 505\tNo one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nT10\tClaim 963 995\tchildren need human interactions\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1119 1383\tAs a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper educatio\nT12\tPremise 1386 1478\tWithout someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'\nT13\tPremise 1538 1610\tonly a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model\nT14\tPremise 997 1117\tNo matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Is it necessary for children or not?\n\nLearning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. \nFirst, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.\nIn addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. \nOverall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 248 324\tIt seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school\nT2\tClaim 326 450\tLearning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1787 1870\tchildren should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education\nT4\tClaim 1583 1768\tit is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 694 773\tThey can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies\nT6\tPremise 460 551\tthe ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life\nT7\tPremise 561 692\tstudents in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 811 902\tthe persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives\nT9\tClaim 1060 1108\tthis time is the best time to learn any language\nA4\tStance T9 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tPremise 1227 1287\tThey would be able to understand other cultures and costumes\nT11\tPremise 1299 1393\tIt can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World\nT12\tPremise 1395 1487\tHaving knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision\nT13\tClaim 1500 1571\tthey would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance\nA3\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1123 1225\tLearning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\n"}

In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. \nFirst, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. \nSecond, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.\nSome people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. \nIn conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 518 595\tstudents should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is\nT2\tClaim 605 705\tin terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 707 819\tClasses are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students\nT4\tPremise 821 964\tProfessors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tMajorClaim 2014 2131\tstudents can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes\nT6\tClaim 2133 2167\tIt's an essential learning process\nA3\tStance T6 For\nT7\tClaim 1221 1291\tclass attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1293 1385\tThose who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes\nT9\tPremise 1144 1203\tMany professors grade their students with class attendances\nT10\tPremise 1028 1142\tAttending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves\nT11\tPremise 975 1026\tit's students' basic responsibility to attend class\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT12\tPremise 1635 1676\tthis is a rather immodest way of thinking\nT13\tPremise 1693 1830\tprofessors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors\nT14\tPremise 1841 1996\teven if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates\nT15\tClaim 1416 1539\tif students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own\nA4\tStance T15 Against\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T15\t\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Taking a break before starting higher education is a good idea\n\nNowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.\nExperience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.\nTaking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.\nIn my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1557 1629\tI would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education\nT2\tClaim 1631 1721\tStudents who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 1723 1816\tThey tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tClaim 375 486\tExperience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 488 568\tIt not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent\nT6\tPremise 570 686\tStudent's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies\nT7\tPremise 688 771\tThis experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life\nT8\tPremise 773 862\tThey develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses\nT10\tPremise 1072 1139\tThey might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment\nT11\tPremise 1141 1223\tThere is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education\nT12\tPremise 1225 1380\tProbably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries\nT13\tPremise 1382 1537\tThis might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification\nT9\tPremise 947 1070\tOnce student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence\nT14\tClaim 864 945\tTaking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts\nA3\tStance T14 Against\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T14\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Government should spend money on ARTs, not only on public services\n\nAs people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.\nAdmittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.\nOn the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.\nFrom the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.\nWith those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 380 451\tarts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well\nT4\tPremise 465 534\tthe government should give priority to public services and facilities\nT5\tClaim 943 1056\tpublic services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 552 722\tthe government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable\nT7\tPremise 740 930\tpublic services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tClaim 1087 1145\tarts should by no means been disregarded by the government\nA4\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1161 1200\tarts can enrich people's cultural lives\nT10\tPremise 1202 1302\tCurrently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition\nT11\tPremise 1318 1429\tthey require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nT12\tPremise 1431 1504\tWithout arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nT2\tMajorClaim 2004 2085\tpublic services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure\nT3\tMajorClaim 2105 2207\tthe authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous\nT13\tClaim 1545 1618\tfunding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development\nA1\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1620 1675\tCultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts\nT15\tPremise 1688 1893\tpreserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry\nT16\tPremise 1909 1950\tarts serve cultural and economic purposes\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T13\t\n"}

{"prompt":"A more convenient life in a city\n\nThere are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.\nOn the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.\nOn the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.\nFurthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. \nThere is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. \nIn conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 295 325\tI prefer to live in a big city\nT2\tClaim 364 455\tI have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 480 558\tI will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace\nT4\tPremise 572 648\tI can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city\t\nT5\tClaim 669 726\tlife in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 728 801\tYou can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities\nT7\tPremise 817 956\tyou can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising\nT8\tPremise 962 1032\ta small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs\t\nT9\tClaim 1046 1132\tliving in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1134 1258\tIf one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals\nT11\tPremise 1273 1413\tthere are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones\nT12\tPremise 1415 1643\tIf one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice\nT13\tClaim 1646 1779\tThere is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring\nT14\tPremise 1781 1980\tSchools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers\nA4\tStance T13 For\nT15\tPremise 1982 2113\tOur children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development\nT16\tMajorClaim 2131 2349\tif I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\n"}

We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off.

{"prompt":"Languages' extinction, discuss both views\n\nIt is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.\nThere are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.\nDespite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication.

{"prompt":"Spending equal amount of money on libraries and sports?\n\nUniversity students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.\nFirst, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football\/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.\nIn addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.\nFinally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. \nIn conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2219 2325\tboth sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories\nT2\tClaim 2123 2205\tI do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tMajorClaim 374 515\tI don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities\nT4\tClaim 535 684\tspending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football\/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 699 820\tmy roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory\nT6\tPremise 822 937\tWhen she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day\nT7\tPremise 951 996\tshe is doing exercise without spending a cent\nT8\tPremise 998 1231\tWhat the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 1300 1387\tThe university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1246 1298\tstudents choose their major based on their interests\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tPremise 1397 1454\ttheir major in completely involved in physical activities\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nT12\tPremise 1469 1579\tfor an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories\nT13\tPremise 1589 1708\tit really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nT14\tPremise 1781 1926\tFor students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose\nT15\tPremise 1940 2105\twhen I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people\nT16\tClaim 1719 1779\tspending money on social activities looks like wasting money\nA4\tStance T16 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Dormitory or apartment?\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. \nOn the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. \nOn the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. \nFrom given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits.

{"prompt":"Machines - positive or negative for humans\n\nAdvancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.\nIt is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.\nOn other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.\nAfter analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1434 1464\tusing machines is advantageous\nT2\tClaim 1468 1502\tmachines make work easy and smooth\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 1504 1562\tThe negative effects on health can be put on the back seat\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 1571 1625\tthere are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tClaim 459 512\tthe usage of machines is harmful for health of humans\nA3\tStance T5 Against\nT6\tPremise 519 560\tmachines decrease the work done by people\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 575 639\tin many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tPremise 641 713\tPeople opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nT9\tPremise 715 817\tIt is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity\nT10\tPremise 822 910\tthis example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\nT11\tPremise 1116 1267\tThe work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes\nT12\tClaim 1298 1370\tusing machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome\nA5\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 964 1058\tusage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work\nT14\tPremise 1060 1114\tTake the example of use of food processors in kitchens\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T5\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"More convincing\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. \nApart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. \nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 469 518\tI agree that face-to-face communication is better\nT2\tMajorClaim 2390 2430\tI prefer to express my opinion in person\nT3\tClaim 2439 2513\tthe advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tMajorClaim 2539 2596\tthe best way of communication is by means of face-to-face\nT5\tPremise 584 630\tcommunicating in person can be more convincing\nT6\tPremise 632 776\tSometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle\nT7\tPremise 778 822\tHe once complained a service of a restaurant\nT8\tPremise 824 957\tWithout exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it\nT9\tPremise 959 1038\tAfterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication\nT10\tPremise 1040 1165\tIf he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important\nT11\tClaim 1178 1260\twe can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way\nA3\tStance T11 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T11\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nT12\tPremise 1346 1406\tit is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T11\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tPremise 1422 1493\tI had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric\nT14\tPremise 1495 1610\tHe said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore\nT15\tPremise 1612 1657\tI just shocked and did not know what happened\nT16\tPremise 1668 1715\tI realized that his facebook account was stolen\nT17\tClaim 1740 1817\twe are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face\nA2\tStance T17 For\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T17\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T17\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T17\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T17\t\nT18\tClaim 1899 2048\tcommunication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication\nA4\tStance T18 Against\nT19\tPremise 2135 2228\tIt is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words\nT20\tPremise 2230 2346\tTalking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nR13\tattacks Arg1:T20 Arg2:T18\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?\n\nIt's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.\nIn the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.\nMeanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.\nFinally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.\nIn conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 250 347\tviolence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study\nT2\tMajorClaim 1494 1615\tgrowing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors\nT3\tClaim 684 751\tunexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 588 676\tIn this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him\nT5\tPremise 521 586\tImagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles\nT6\tPremise 469 519\tNowadays children are more involved in TV programs\nT7\tPremise 369 467\tchildren behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tClaim 922 1031\tif these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 893 909\tkilling is worse\nT10\tPremise 837 878\tdying is always a disappointing happening\nT11\tPremise 764 821\thuman beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tClaim 1404 1452\tthe study of a youngster would affected terribly\nT13\tPremise 1319 1395\tit is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly\nT14\tPremise 1256 1317\the is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tPremise 1199 1227\the has to study for the exam\nT16\tPremise 1143 1178\ta child watches a frightening movie\nT17\tPremise 1076 1128\tthe study of youngsters shall always been controlled\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T12\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T12\t\nA3\tStance T12 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Some celebrities misguide young people& some guide them in right direction\n\nSome people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.\nIt is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. \nNevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance.

{"prompt":"Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives\n\nThere are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.\nFirst, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. \nSecond, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. \nMoreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. \nAll in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 336 408\tlearning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives\nT2\tPremise 476 599\twhen students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations\nT3\tPremise 621 733\tmore information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts\nT4\tClaim 748 835\tthey would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 1099 1234\tif they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life\nT6\tClaim 846 888\tit would improve students' social behavior\nA1\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 890 992\tIf students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well\nT8\tPremise 994 1091\tThey should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well\t\nT9\tPremise 1535 1597\tIt can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position\nT10\tClaim 1352 1451\twhen a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently\nT11\tPremise 1470 1533\tconcerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life\nT12\tPremise 1247 1329\tthese way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts\t\nT13\tMajorClaim 1636 1717\tlearning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life\nT14\tClaim 1758 1903\tStudents would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc\nA4\tStance T14 For\nA5\tStance T10 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Modern cooking methods have improved our life-style significantly\n\nWith technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.\nFirst of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.\nAt the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.\nIn conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals.

{"prompt":"Vegetarianism - why some people are choosing to become vegetarian?\n\nSince the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.\nFirstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.\nSecondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.\nTo sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals.

{"prompt":"Success and knowledge\n\nMany people think that \"Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors\". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. \nFirst of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.\nSecondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them.

{"prompt":"Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life\n\nI agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.\nStarting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. \nAnother great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.\nUsing your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.\nChildhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 83 129\tchildhood is the happiest period of one's life\nT2\tClaim 131 350\tIt's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 615 715\tduring our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 717 864\tBeing late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 352 449\tStarting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives\nT6\tPremise 451 539\tWe are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave\nT7\tPremise 541 609\tEvery action we make are watched closely and judged by the community\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tClaim 1227 1294\tchildhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1123 1214\tThere are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see\nT10\tPremise 867 1002\tAnother great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day\nT11\tPremise 1004 1121\tBeing a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tPremise 1396 1558\tChildren are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination\nT13\tPremise 1560 1627\tIn adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries\nT14\tPremise 1639 1696\tthey are in no way free to think or use their imagination\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nT15\tClaim 1296 1394\tUsing your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child\nA4\tStance T15 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tMajorClaim 1698 1764\tChildhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives\nT17\tClaim 1766 1886\tIt's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults\nA5\tStance T17 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Why should human beings travel to outer space?\n\nFor many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.\nFirstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.\nSecondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.\nFinally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.\nAs a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1542 1583\thuman beings should travel to outer space\nT2\tMajorClaim 437 501\tthere are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space\nT3\tClaim 512 559\tmany facts about solar system can be discovered\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 575 641\ta picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat\nT5\tPremise 667 724\tit is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa\nT6\tPremise 726 798\tIf it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 810 860\tpeople can know more about the planet earth itself\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 862 991\tBy observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth\nT9\tPremise 993 1090\tWith this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nT10\tClaim 1101 1157\ta great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1159 1308\tAs astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks\nT12\tPremise 1310 1399\tOxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater\nT13\tPremise 1411 1499\tspaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\n"}

Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.\nFirst of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.\nIn addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.\nLast but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.\nTo conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world.

{"prompt":"Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does\n\nWith the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.\nAdmittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. \nHowever, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. \nSecond, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.\nIn conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 290 350\tliving environment is more important than job for most of us\nT2\tClaim 364 390\tjob can bring us happiness\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 392 451\tPeople can receive a sense of values and respected from job\nT4\tPremise 453 538\tIf people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence\nT5\tClaim 553 580\tjob can provide money to us\nA2\tStance T5 Against\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tClaim 592 658\tpeople should concern more about their living environment than job\nA3\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 667 723\tfor most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives\nT8\tPremise 725 769\tFew people can feel happiness from their job\nT9\tPremise 778 826\tthey have to continue to work more than 30 years\nT10\tPremise 841 971\tWorkers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day\nT11\tPremise 973 1037\tThese labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness\nT12\tPremise 1046 1097\tthey feel tired and frustrated after long hour work\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nT13\tClaim 1108 1221\tbeautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people\nA4\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1223 1313\tWithout beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety\nT15\tPremise 1315 1409\tNowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly\nT16\tPremise 1411 1474\tFactories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil\nT17\tPremise 1476 1539\tIn order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests\nT18\tPremise 1541 1617\tIn China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick\nT19\tPremise 1626 1713\tthese factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nT20\tPremise 1727 1823\tlocal residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories\nT21\tPremise 1825 1872\tthey cannot feel happiness from high-paying job\nT22\tPremise 1885 1934\tmost of them suffer from cancer or other diseases\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T21\t\nR11\tattacks Arg1:T21 Arg2:T20\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T13\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T13\t\nR16\tattacks Arg1:T20 Arg2:T13\t\nT23\tMajorClaim 1951 2034\tit is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work\nT24\tClaim 2041 2075\tthe goal people is for good livers\nA5\tStance T24 For\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Computers - use, future prospects and over-dependence\n\nComputer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as \"Father of computers\") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.\nIn the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.\nMoreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.\nHowever, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.\nNevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective.

{"prompt":"A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues\n\nIn today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.\nThe second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.\nIn conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1619 1812\ta greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being\nT2\tMajorClaim 274 387\tgovernments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions\nT3\tPremise 410 524\teducation and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system\nT4\tPremise 541 723\tdecreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients\nT5\tClaim 736 944\tsociety should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients\nA2\tStance T5 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nT6\tClaim 968 1095\tgovernments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society\nA3\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 1112 1220\tthere is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health\nT8\tPremise 1233 1388\ta government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives\nT9\tPremise 1403 1602\tthe marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Farmland, housing and industry or saving land for animals?\n\nNowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.\nFirst, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.\nSecond, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. \nLast I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.\nAll in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 398 463\thuman needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important\nT2\tClaim 2121 2163\tprotecting endangered animals is necessary\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tMajorClaim 2179 2244\thuman needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important\nT4\tPremise 520 602\tland used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society\nT5\tPremise 626 815\tthe economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy\nT6\tPremise 825 855\tthey produce plenty of profits\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 871 943\tthe society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry\nT8\tPremise 976 1096\tmore farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tClaim 1103 1166\tthe needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important\nA3\tStance T9 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tClaim 1176 1264\tfarmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1296 1413\tfarming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live\nT12\tPremise 1415 1484\tEspecially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing\nT13\tPremise 1499 1614\thighly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nT14\tClaim 1741 1789\tit can do good to protect the endangered animals\nA5\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1660 1739\tfarmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nT16\tPremise 1823 1882\tagriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy\nT17\tPremise 1914 1982\twe can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals\nT18\tPremise 1997 2107\twe can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Gender Equality at university admission\n\nNowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.\nUniversities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. \nHowever, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1498 1562\tuniversities must open choice for everyone to select his subject\nT2\tClaim 1774 1825\twe must give them opportunity to achieve their goal\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 1564 1618\tOur youth has become very confident towards his career\nT4\tPremise 1620 1673\tThey are not ready to be bound in certain limitations\nT5\tPremise 1675 1769\tFemale candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tClaim 407 475\tUniversities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 514 589\twomen have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor\nT8\tPremise 604 660\tnowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky\nT9\tPremise 662 729\tThey are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also\nT10\tPremise 744 822\tuniversity authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination\nT11\tPremise 824 907\tThey must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nT12\tClaim 1357 1459\tuniversities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender\nA3\tStance T12 Against\nT13\tPremise 919 978\tthe current job market affects the decision of universities\nT14\tPremise 980 1051\tEvery university designs its courses according to the need of employers\nT15\tPremise 1053 1095\tThe job selection criteria are pre decided\nT16\tPremise 1110 1211\temployers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine\nT17\tPremise 1213 1252\tThey prefer male staff for night shifts\nT18\tPremise 1254 1344\tThey want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Our useful friends\n\nPets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.\nFirst, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.\nSecondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. \nTo sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 354 394\tpets should be treated like human beings\nT2\tPremise 602 655\tthey listen to us, more than some people will ever do\nT3\tPremise 574 593\tWe can talk to them\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nT4\tPremise 720 816\tWhen I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important\nT5\tPremise 818 855\tTalking to my friends was frustrating\nT6\tPremise 864 900\tnone of them have ever felt that way\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 908 947\tI was all alone at home for a long time\nT8\tPremise 949 1037\tmy dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings\nT9\tPremise 1057 1090\tpets aren't able to speak with us\nT10\tPremise 1092 1124\twe can nonetheless count on them\nR3\tattacks Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tattacks Arg1:T9 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T2\t\nT11\tClaim 425 481\tpets are our friends as well as certain human beings are\nA1\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 483 572\tSimilarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tPremise 1190 1251\tnowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before\nT14\tPremise 1253 1339\tResearchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses\nT15\tPremise 1341 1393\tThere are dogs who lead blind people around the city\nT16\tPremise 1470 1517\tpets are important for depressed people as well\nT17\tPremise 1408 1455\twithout them they could not go around all alone\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T17\t\nT18\tPremise 1526 1562\ttheir presence make them feel better\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tPremise 1574 1681\tthere are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs\nT20\tClaim 1136 1175\tpets are useful for a variety of things\nA2\tStance T20 For\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T20\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T20\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T20\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T20\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T20\t\nT21\tMajorClaim 1724 1770\tpets deserve to be treated like family members\nT22\tClaim 1822 1884\tthey are our friends and they can be useful in many situations\nA3\tStance T22 For\n"}
{"prompt":"University education is needed for success\n\nIn today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.\nFirst and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.\nLooking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.\nIn addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.\nTo wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 397 458\tone can also shine without even having to attend universities\nT2\tMajorClaim 2177 2295\tit would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions\nT3\tClaim 2065 2166\tit is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tClaim 480 613\tit is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer\nA2\tStance T4 Against\nT5\tPremise 615 724\tWithout proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers\nT6\tPremise 726 886\tNot only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners\nT7\tPremise 888 980\tThis can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tClaim 1016 1129\tthere are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1131 1183\tTake for instance those who start their own business\nT10\tPremise 1185 1233\tThese people depend solely on hard work and luck\nT11\tPremise 1250 1299\tfor some of them it proved to be a profitable job\nT12\tPremise 1321 1391\tMichael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19\nT13\tPremise 1404 1460\the started his computer company in his college dorm room\nT14\tPremise 1474 1564\the used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T8\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T8\t\nT15\tPremise 1579 1650\tpeople with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life\nT16\tClaim 1974 2044\tindividuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful\nA5\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 1652 1716\tThis is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports\nT18\tPremise 1718 1830\tThe introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph\nT19\tPremise 1860 1946\tDavid Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail\n\nWhen it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. \nFirstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. \nSecondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. \nAdmittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place.

{"prompt":"E-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face\n\nTechnology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.\nEveryone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.\nIn addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.\nLast but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. \nOn the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 270 363\tI prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating\nT2\tClaim 386 430\te-mail has been a great way of communication\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 432 474\tYou can talk to others from thousands mile\nT4\tPremise 490 610\tif you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact\nT5\tPremise 612 686\tWe will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address\nT6\tPremise 688 742\tIf the address is wrong, then you will know right away\nT7\tPremise 754 801\te-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click\nT8\tPremise 1165 1212\te-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out\nT9\tClaim 816 860\twriting e-mail helps people express honestly\nT10\tPremise 885 937\tthe face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid\nT11\tPremise 939 1005\tSometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect\nT12\tPremise 1021 1152\tI want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do\nT13\tPremise 1214 1302\tShe will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed\nT14\tPremise 1304 1387\tI don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive\nT15\tClaim 1855 1919\tE-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive\nA3\tStance T15 For\nT16\tPremise 1409 1442\tevery communication needs fluency\nT17\tPremise 1446 1518\tpeople can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time\nT18\tPremise 1520 1615\tVoice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident\nT19\tPremise 1630 1708\twhen I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively\nT20\tPremise 1710 1798\tThey may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say\nT21\tPremise 1800 1853\tAnyone can meet this problem once in any conversation\nT22\tMajorClaim 1997 2047\te-mail is the greatest way for major people to use\nT23\tClaim 2049 2079\tIts convenience saves our time\nA4\tStance T23 For\nA2\tStance T9 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T2\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T8\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T8\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T18\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T18\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T15\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T15\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Living in smal towns\n\nPlace of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.\nFirstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.\nSecondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.\nIn conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities.

{"prompt":"Amount of control on media information\n\nNowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.\nOne of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.\nThe major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.\nBoth sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1679 1807\tthe government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information\nT2\tMajorClaim 331 455\tit should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures\nT3\tClaim 457 562\tOne of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 564 617\tThey have a serious impact on people in their puberty\nT5\tPremise 632 761\tan internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off\nT6\tClaim 797 952\ttelevision companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture\nT7\tPremise 954 1049\tA few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser\nT8\tPremise 1051 1099\tThis is actually very environmentally unfriendly\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 1183 1316\tthe government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases\nA2\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 1318 1470\tTaking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths\nT11\tPremise 1481 1567\tanother perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nA3\tStance T6 For\n"}

Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.\nMoney is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion.

On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark.

{"prompt":"New building construction hold the right to gain more money from government\n\nThe housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.\nBuilding more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.\nOtherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor.

{"prompt":"Students should attend to classes or it should be optional?\n\nNowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.\nFirst and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. \nAnother significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. \nFinally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times.

{"prompt":"Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways\n\nNowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.\nFirst and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. \nIn addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.\nIn conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T3\tMajorClaim 328 397\tgovernments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment\nT4\tClaim 484 578\tthey help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air\nA1\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 399 473\tSuch public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT1\tClaim 1244 1353\tthe policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth\nA2\tStance T1 For\nT2\tPremise 1086 1231\tif there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nT6\tPremise 637 713\tcarbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere\nT7\tPremise 732 820\tthe more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged\nT8\tPremise 822 945\tIf governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work\nT9\tClaim 947 1075\tThis is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment\nA4\tStance T9 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tPremise 1554 1607\tthere are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads\nT11\tPremise 1432 1513\tIt is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities\nT12\tClaim 1641 1732\tgovernments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes\nT13\tPremise 1734 1853\tThere is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion\nT14\tPremise 1369 1430\tthe policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam\nT15\tClaim 1891 1952\thigh-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around\nA5\tStance T15 Against\nT16\tMajorClaim 1968 2033\tpublic transportation systems even have more important advantages\nT17\tClaim 2035 2097\tThey not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere\nA6\tStance T17 For\nA3\tStance T12 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should parents limit their children watching TV to make them do well in school?\n\nIn 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.\nFirst of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.\nMoreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?\nAdmittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. \nIn considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 502 575\tchildren should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively\nT2\tPremise 591 670\tchildren generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily\nT3\tClaim 672 800\tWatching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents\nA2\tStance T3 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nT4\tPremise 847 963\tWhenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours\nT5\tPremise 965 1066\tI could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes\nT6\tPremise 1068 1180\tI could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook\nT7\tPremise 1182 1251\tI, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tPremise 1348 1420\tChildren are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad\nT9\tPremise 1432 1501\tthey are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tPremise 1503 1541\tRecently, more and more children smoke\nT11\tPremise 1550 1596\tthey imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 1617 1759\taccording to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies\nT13\tClaim 1780 1877\tthere are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health\nT14\tPremise 1263 1346\tsometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children\nA3\tStance T13 For\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T13\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tPremise 2224 2327\tit doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching\nT16\tClaim 2057 2169\tchildren should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation\nA4\tStance T16 Against\nR15\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\nT17\tMajorClaim 2330 2477\tIn considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue\nT18\tClaim 2487 2641\tchildren are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies\nA5\tStance T18 For\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"School memories\n\nEveryone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.\nFirst, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.\nSecond, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.\nIn other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life.

Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person.

Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.\nBesides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.\nOn the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions.

{"prompt":"Improved medical care\n\nAlong with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.\nThe main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.\nIn addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.\nOn the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system.

{"prompt":"Should all the advertisements be banned?\n\nNever in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.\nFirst, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.\nBesides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.\nThat is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.\nTaken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 343 435\twhile some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring\nT2\tMajorClaim 1452 1531\tadvertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth\nT3\tClaim 444 537\tit is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 744 837\tpublicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tClaim 1221 1382\tthe advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies\nA3\tStance T5 Against\nT6\tPremise 548 714\tthey are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor\nT7\tPremise 858 962\tit could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country\nT8\tPremise 964 1140\tA recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic\nT9\tPremise 1389 1430\tits merits still outweigh these downsides\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tattacks Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Use of CCTV cameras\n\nToday, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.\nFirstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.\nFurthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.\nLooking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.\nTo conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 504 638\tCCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace\nT2\tMajorClaim 2404 2479\tCCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise\nT3\tClaim 2481 2560\tThis is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 2574 2622\tprivacies are lost with the use of these cameras\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 2637 2683\tsafety should be put first in order to be safe\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tClaim 1229 1300\tCCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 649 728\tby having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down\nT8\tPremise 746 877\twhen a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced\nT9\tPremise 907 1080\tin Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight\nT10\tPremise 1097 1204\tas the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nT11\tPremise 1511 1588\tthe installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation\nT12\tClaim 1805 1899\tthese cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1597 1663\tthe customers know very well that their conversations are recorded\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nT14\tPremise 1315 1400\tat some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers\nT15\tPremise 1412 1502\tface-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT16\tClaim 1983 2096\tThose opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras\nA5\tStance T16 Against\nT17\tPremise 2107 2251\tone must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences\nT18\tPremise 2259 2389\topponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tPremise 1694 1793\tthe videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T12\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\n"}
{"prompt":"A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues\n\nIn today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.\nThe second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.\nIn conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 274 387\tgovernments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions\nT2\tMajorClaim 1619 1812\ta greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being\nT3\tClaim 736 796\tsociety should be educated and became aware of health issues\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 541 723\tdecreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 805 944\tthe potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tPremise 389 524\tThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tPremise 1112 1220\tthere is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health\nT8\tPremise 1233 1388\ta government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives\nT9\tPremise 1403 1602\tthe marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign\nT10\tClaim 968 1095\tgovernments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society\nA3\tStance T10 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more\n\nNowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.\nFirstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.\nSecondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.\nFinally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. \nTo conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need.

{"prompt":"Prevention is better than cure\n\nIt is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.\nHealth education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.\nPreventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment.

{"prompt":"Are parents best teachers?\n\nIt is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.\nFirst, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.\nSecond, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.\nThird, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life.

{"prompt":"People learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer?\n\nPeople have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.\nFirst of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. \nSecondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.\nAnother reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things.

{"prompt":"Reasons why travelers visit Museums?\n\nMany people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.\nThe first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.\nHowever, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.\nIn coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world.

{"prompt":"Friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible\n\nThere is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. \nFirst of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. \nSecond, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.\nI think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 336 389\tfriendship is more important than mistake by a friend\nT2\tClaim 400 419\tmistake is terrible\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 501 571\ta mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever\nT4\tPremise 573 607\tAnybody does not remember mistakes\nT5\tPremise 609 666\tIf someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind\nT6\tPremise 687 721\tmistakes will be forgotten quickly\nT7\tPremise 736 795\tmy friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift\nT8\tPremise 806 873\tI forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him\nT9\tClaim 921 964\tmistake is more forgettable than friendship\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1301 1331\ta friend is a gift of our life\nT11\tPremise 1197 1292\twhen the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it\nT12\tPremise 1333 1409\tAccording to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend\nT13\tPremise 1116 1186\tif a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship\nT14\tPremise 1009 1106\tif you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you\nT15\tClaim 975 998\tEverybody makes mistake\nA4\tStance T15 For\nT16\tMajorClaim 1424 1477\ta mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big\nT17\tClaim 1486 1525\tfriendship is forever and gift our life\nA5\tStance T17 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Study at home by using technology\/study or traditional school\n\nI don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. \nStudying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.\nFirst, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. \nSecond, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.\nFurthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. \nFor the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 63 127\tI don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom\nT2\tMajorClaim 1832 1883\tdistance education can't replace traditional school\nT3\tClaim 151 201\tStudying at home by using technology is convenient\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 203 291\tThe biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day\nT5\tPremise 306 384\tyou could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course\nT6\tPremise 386 417\tYou can study any time you want\nT7\tPremise 428 552\tif you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tattacks Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tPremise 908 988\tit may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help\nT9\tPremise 561 632\tattending an education course at home requires persistence and patience\nT10\tPremise 645 784\twhen you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements\nT11\tClaim 786 891\tStudents may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects\nA3\tStance T11 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nT12\tClaim 1207 1286\tStudents may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision\nA2\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1288 1383\tIf you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tPremise 999 1059\tstudying at home is very different from traditional learning\nT15\tPremise 1061 1205\tUnlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT16\tClaim 1398 1499\tthere is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates\nA4\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 1501 1541\tWe can learn a lot from programs at home\nT18\tPremise 1552 1624\tour computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people\nT19\tPremise 1639 1704\tstudents may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T16\t\nT20\tPremise 1706 1793\tStudying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities\nR13\tattacks Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR11\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Type of temper and advantages of individual work as best arguments in favor of studying alone\n\nStudy achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.\nTo begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.\nFurthermore\/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own \"team\" I gained a victory.\nIn conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1432 1541\ttype of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone\nT2\tClaim 794 873\tmy productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 481 600\tBeing by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people\nT4\tPremise 602 781\tOnce, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tPremise 1026 1148\tI must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding\nT6\tPremise 1150 1225\tThese advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time\nT7\tPremise 1227 1309\tAbout a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game\nT8\tPremise 1311 1392\tTo my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own \"team\" I gained a victory\nT9\tClaim 897 1008\tworking alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork\nA2\tStance T9 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Giving mobile phones to the unemployed\n\nToday, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.\nIn a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.\nNonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.\nFurthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.\nTo put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 444 515\tgiving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money\nT2\tMajorClaim 2307 2460\tproviding those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment\nT3\tPremise 546 684\twhen people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities\nT4\tClaim 1081 1227\tif the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive\nA2\tStance T4 Against\nT5\tPremise 699 787\tthey can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them\nT6\tPremise 789 947\tWith the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job\nT7\tPremise 964 1069\tthe mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tPremise 1276 1350\tsupplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money\nT9\tClaim 1662 1753\tthe money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed\nA4\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1368 1485\tthe money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country\nT11\tPremise 1515 1647\tthe money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT12\tClaim 1768 1861\twhen hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity\nA5\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1863 1957\tIt will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless\nT14\tPremise 1959 2070\tSome might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones\nT15\tPremise 2089 2128\tthe public's money is spent worthlessly\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT16\tClaim 2146 2262\ttill now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment\nA6\tStance T16 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\n"}

{"prompt":"Prevention is better than cure\n\nThere has always been a saying in medicine: \"Prevention is better than cure\". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.\nNo one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle.

{"prompt":"Easy preparation of food leads to a better life\n\nThe Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.\nFirstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.\nSecondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he\/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.\nAll in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1206 1254\tease to prepare food has improved people’s lives\nT2\tClaim 1327 1374\tBut people should be careful with what they eat\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 1384 1435\tsome industrial foods are very bad for their health\nT4\tPremise 1440 1488\tthey should buy only food from well known brands\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tClaim 493 590\tbeing able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 438 487\tthey don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen\nT7\tPremise 378 419\tpeople normally have lots of things to do\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tPremise 605 780\tif an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nT9\tClaim 792 995\twhen someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he\/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1010 1120\tif a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions\nT11\tPremise 1122 1187\tNormally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Capital punishment; 51% countries have polished death penalty\n\n\"Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime.\" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.\nFirstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.\nSecondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.\nFinally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. \nTo conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 607 684\tit is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty\nT2\tClaim 1063 1146\tdeath penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 790 933\tCrimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one\nT4\tPremise 950 986\tthe criminal is repeated second time\nT5\tPremise 719 788\tcapital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture\nT6\tPremise 1229 1295\tthe rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being\nT7\tPremise 1297 1374\tNo one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder\nT8\tPremise 1376 1421\tIf you kill a criminal, you become a criminal\nT9\tClaim 1158 1205\tnobody has the right to take another human life\nA2\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1543 1596\tcrimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment\nT11\tPremise 1433 1531\tif we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral\nT12\tPremise 1727 1828\tIf they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them\nT13\tPremise 1830 1868\tThey do not undergo any pain or misery\nT14\tPremise 1678 1725\tCriminals should be punished for their misdeeds\nT15\tClaim 1607 1676\twith some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out\nT16\tMajorClaim 2453 2530\tThe world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty\nT17\tPremise 2228 2358\tcapital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life\nT18\tClaim 2366 2451\tit neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society\nA5\tStance T18 For\nT19\tPremise 2116 2212\trehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts\nT20\tPremise 2022 2104\tWhy do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better\nT21\tPremise 1929 2020\tsome industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors\nA4\tStance T15 For\nT22\tPremise 994 1054\tit is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T22\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T15\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T15\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T15\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T18\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Competition or co-operation-which is better\n\nThe modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.\nCo-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.\nNevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.\nUnfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.\nHowever, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.\nThus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2055 2133\tchildren should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition\nT2\tClaim 375 413\tCo-operation is essential for teamwork\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 415 493\tEducational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children\nT4\tPremise 495 570\tWe live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success\nT5\tPremise 572 627\tA person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself\nT6\tPremise 643 663\tlions hunt in a team\nT7\tPremise 665 751\tIt is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 770 850\tco-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T2\t\nT9\tClaim 866 946\tco-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes\nA2\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 948 1021\tIt helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others\nT11\tPremise 1023 1131\tA co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements\nT12\tPremise 1142 1190\tcompetition is also as important as co-operation\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nT13\tClaim 1419 1465\tCompetition helps in improvement and evolution\nA3\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1273 1351\tAn individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others\nT15\tPremise 1353 1417\tCompetition has helped the development of science and technology\nT16\tPremise 1480 1569\tevery other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others\nT17\tPremise 1571 1624\tThis kind of competition gives customers more options\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nT18\tClaim 1761 1820\tCompetition should be always based on self-improvement rule\nA4\tStance T18 Against\nT19\tPremise 1635 1679\tblind and selfish competition is detrimental\nT20\tPremise 1681 1759\t'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run\nT21\tPremise 1822 1916\tA healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T18\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T18\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Establishing a new university in your community\n\nI will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.\nThis new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.\nUndoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled.

{"prompt":"Old buildings should be preserved\n\nThe preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.\nThere are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. \nOld buildings are an essential part of history.

Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. .

{"prompt":"Businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life\n\nMany entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. \nFirst and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.\nSecondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. \nLast but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. \nIn a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life.

{"prompt":"Negative effects of technological process\n\nIt is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.\nFirstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.\nHowever, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.\nIn conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization.

{"prompt":"Tv has NO negative effects on children\n\nNowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.\nFirst of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. \nIn addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.\nIn conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 262 320\ttelevision has more positive effects than negative effects\nT2\tClaim 1518 1558\tthe television can have violent programs\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 1569 1662\tif children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tMajorClaim 1784 1871\tI strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children\nT5\tPremise 1674 1763\tit has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children\nT6\tClaim 378 424\ttelevision has useful and educational programs\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 426 519\tNot only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes\nT8\tPremise 521 603\tIf children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it\nT9\tPremise 618 654\tin Korea, there's program called EBS\nT10\tPremise 656 695\tIt is targeted for children to teenager\nT11\tPremise 697 738\tWe can study subjects through EBS lecture\nT12\tPremise 746 819\tthere are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea\nT13\tPremise 821 923\tUsing those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T6\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T6\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T6\t\nT14\tClaim 939 976\tTv is helpful to relieve our stresses\nA3\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1030 1075\tMany children have a lot of stresses recently\nT16\tPremise 1083 1121\tthey have so much pressure about study\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nT17\tPremise 1123 1198\tWhen they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nT18\tPremise 1215 1252\tI got too much stress from the school\nT19\tPremise 1258 1280\tI was quite aggressive\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T19\t\nT20\tPremise 1291 1366\tAfter I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone\nT21\tPremise 1377 1449\tthis soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school\nT22\tPremise 1457 1490\tit helped me to relieve my stress\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T21\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T14\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T14\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T14\t\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling?\n\nIn my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.\nA student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.\nAnother reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.\nIn addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.\nThus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies.

{"prompt":"It is essential to have ability to plan and organize\n\nWith the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.\nFirst of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.\nEqually important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.\nFinally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.\nIn this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 284 350\tit can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions\nA1\tStance T1 For\nT2\tMajorClaim 183 277\tit is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize\nT3\tClaim 410 506\tgreat planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 508 684\tTake myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term\nT5\tPremise 686 897\tYet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control\nT6\tPremise 899 1009\tThis plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 1030 1184\tthe capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1202 1337\tthe employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly\nT9\tPremise 1339 1496\tIf some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tPremise 1664 1833\tthose employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired\nT11\tPremise 1835 1882\tEvery employee can not afford this kind of loss\nT12\tPremise 1561 1648\tthe deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nT13\tClaim 1987 2042\tit is not need for young people to possess this ability\nA4\tStance T13 Against\nT14\tPremise 1910 1979\tthe ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tPremise 2058 2105\tthis ability is also essential for young people\nT16\tPremise 2112 2209\tyoung people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nT17\tPremise 2211 2346\tAs searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs\nT18\tPremise 2371 2432\tthey would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where\nT19\tPremise 2434 2470\tIt is obviously a huge waste of time\nT20\tPremise 2476 2614\tif they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination\nR11\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T20\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T20\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T20\t\nT21\tMajorClaim 2699 2801\tthe ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with\nT22\tClaim 2616 2694\tIn this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks\nA5\tStance T22 For\nR12\tattacks Arg1:T20 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Attending university classes should be required or optional\n\nAttending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.\nFirstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.\nSecondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. \nIn conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 286 334\tgoing to classes should be optional for students\nT2\tClaim 448 547\tsometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 549 651\tStudent can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand\nT4\tPremise 666 744\tI have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university\nT5\tPremise 746 808\tShe learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast\nT6\tPremise 816 890\tshe rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic\nT7\tPremise 901 948\tshe got very good grade when she was graduation\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT8\tClaim 1018 1145\tthey can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1165 1276\tmany times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes\nT10\tPremise 1284 1352\tI had already studied all biology topics before attending university\nT11\tPremise 1367 1470\tI spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tMajorClaim 1704 1784\tattending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore\nT13\tClaim 1496 1612\tthe students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time\nA3\tStance T13 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Haste makes waste\n\nThis saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:\nFor one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.\nIn addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position.

{"prompt":"Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.\nA raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.\nNevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.\nTo sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1562 1648\ta higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees\nT2\tMajorClaim 1665 1769\tproviding a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity\nT3\tClaim 1776 1856\tthey will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 346 423\tA raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tClaim 1055 1203\tcreating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances\nA3\tStance T5 Against\nT6\tPremise 425 533\tWorkers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile\nT7\tPremise 549 704\tjunior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work\nT8\tPremise 726 812\tit is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want\nT9\tPremise 814 1024\tIf the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan\nT10\tPremise 1205 1361\tTake Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce\nT11\tPremise 1378 1534\tthe employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T5\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Television versus Friends and family\n\nWe all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.\nFirst of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.\nSecondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.\nLast but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?\nIn conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 264 352\tI personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us\nT2\tMajorClaim 1640 1695\tit has destroyed communication among friends and family\nT3\tClaim 1608 1638\ttelevision has some good sides\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tClaim 408 440\tthey can be isolated from others\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 374 406\tpeople watch television too much\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 442 654\tChildren, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others\nT7\tPremise 656 728\tGradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tClaim 978 1054\tchildren will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 740 847\twith the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common\nT10\tPremise 849 958\tParents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT11\tClaim 1168 1225\tcommunication between family members is visibly destroyed\nA4\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1066 1153\tparents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tClaim 1247 1350\twatching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human\nA5\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1365 1455\twatching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Living with a roommate is better than Living alone\n\nMany single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.\nLiving with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.\nApart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.\nFinally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.\nIn conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 319 351\tI prefer to live with a roommate\nT2\tClaim 369 438\tit saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 2190 2241\tI prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will\nT4\tClaim 2136 2188\tmany people decide to live alone for various reasons\nA2\tStance T4 Against\nT5\tClaim 2259 2343\tit offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tClaim 440 486\tLiving with a roommate saves me a lot of money\nA4\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 488 558\tIf you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them\nT8\tPremise 571 596\tyou can get more for less\nT9\tPremise 611 819\tlast year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly\nT10\tPremise 821 929\tI was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills\nT11\tClaim 965 1028\tliving with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily\nA5\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1030 1103\tIt is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you\nT13\tPremise 1105 1183\tYou can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together\nT14\tPremise 1199 1256\tone night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along\nT15\tPremise 1258 1357\tEven though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other\nT16\tPremise 1359 1416\tWe soon found out that everyone loved playing video games\nT17\tPremise 1418 1498\tWe played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends\nT18\tPremise 1500 1558\tLiving with a roommate made socializing much easier for me\nT19\tClaim 1569 1613\tliving with a roommate allows me to get help\nA7\tStance T19 For\nT20\tPremise 1615 1693\tIt often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need\nT21\tPremise 1695 1767\tWhen you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help\nT22\tPremise 1769 1809\tSome of them may have something to offer\nT23\tPremise 1826 1915\twhen my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help\nT24\tPremise 1917 1960\tThey failed to give me any useful solutions\nT25\tPremise 1962 2037\tTo my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help\nT26\tPremise 2039 2113\tHe was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T11\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T11\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T19\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T19\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T19\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T19\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T24 Arg2:T19\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T25 Arg2:T19\t\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T26 Arg2:T19\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Working at home vs Working in a company\n\nDue to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.\nFirst of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he\/she can assemble his\/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he\/she can call the MIS staff to fix.\nSecond, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.\nIn conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 407 477\tworking at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office\nT2\tMajorClaim 1531 1616\tworking in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency\nT4\tPremise 648 815\tThink about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he\/she can assemble his\/her colleges right away and discuss\nT5\tPremise 573 646\tThey can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together\nT6\tPremise 817 883\tIt's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone\nT7\tPremise 906 991\tif one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he\/she can call the MIS staff to fix\nT8\tClaim 493 571\twhile working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tClaim 1001 1088\tworking at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1103 1153\tpeople are easily distracted while working at home\nT11\tPremise 1155 1250\tIt's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away\nT12\tPremise 1265 1371\twhile people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing\nT13\tPremise 1383 1514\tpeople who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss\nT3\tClaim 1618 1778\tIt not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home\nA1\tStance T3 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9\t\n"}

{"prompt":"Should students be required to attend classes?\n\nThe issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.\nFirstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.\nSecondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.\nIn addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.\nFinally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.\nTo conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students.

{"prompt":"Should wealthy nations support poor ones?\n\nWhether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.\nIn terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.\nEconomically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.\nIn summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways.

{"prompt":"Will newspapers become a thing of the past?\n\nThe internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.\nFirst of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.\nAnother point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.\nLast, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.\nIn conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 374 459\tnewspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence\nT2\tClaim 1090 1175\tthe print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 554 650\tto obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers\nT4\tPremise 652 888\tContrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime\nT5\tPremise 890 1081\tAs can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tClaim 1706 1838\tthe number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 1200 1324\tfrom the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one\nT8\tPremise 1356 1439\tthe internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries\nT9\tPremise 1624 1687\tThe answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT10\tClaim 2107 2188\tnewspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1861 1993\twhen taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down\nT12\tPremise 1995 2090\tThis is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The zoo deserves maintenance and public respect\n\nFor a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.\nFirst of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.\nSecondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.\nIn sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 212 259\tthe zoo deserves maintenance and public respect\nT2\tPremise 417 536\tWith zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile\nT3\tPremise 731 793\tzoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels\nT4\tClaim 300 415\tthe zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 557 709\tit is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tMajorClaim 1252 1327\tthe role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable\nT7\tPremise 861 1002\tNowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos\nT8\tPremise 1018 1099\tthe ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species\nT9\tPremise 1101 1242\tOnly when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory\nT10\tClaim 805 859\tthe zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection\nA3\tStance T10 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\n"}
{"prompt":"People will spend less time on cooking food\n\nPerhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.\nThe first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.\nAnother reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.\nSome people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.\nTo sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 271 323\tpeople are likely to spend less time in cooking food\nT2\tMajorClaim 2788 2831\tpeople will spend less time in cooking food\nT3\tClaim 1119 1205\tit is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 717 829\tpeople nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years\nT5\tPremise 468 702\twith the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 841 1016\tin recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework\nT7\tPremise 1018 1111\tAnd this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tPremise 1646 1700\tthey find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal\nT9\tPremise 1401 1638\t89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tClaim 1230 1286\tmost of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants\nA2\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1702 1822\tEven they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 2478 2576\tit is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time\nT13\tClaim 1851 1955\tinvesting much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family\nT14\tPremise 1994 2102\tas a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality\nT15\tPremise 2245 2281\thealth and life of eaters is assured\nT16\tPremise 2104 2238\tEven, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nT17\tPremise 2292 2462\talong with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nA4\tStance T13 Against\nR12\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nT18\tPremise 1295 1369\tthey want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Police force carries guns - significant impact for level of violence\n\nThe increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.\nFirst of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.\nSecondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.\nIn conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 287 357\tthis trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society\nT2\tClaim 1533 1587\tbeing armed with guns in the police force is necessary\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tMajorClaim 1589 1631\tit will bring the higher level of violence\nT4\tClaim 1064 1156\ta society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 498 642\twe need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself\nT6\tPremise 657 820\tcriminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs\nT7\tPremise 828 906\tcitizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 918 1051\twhile on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 1385 1485\tThose are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1231 1372\tpeople and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson\nT11\tPremise 1168 1222\tpolice force carries guns only in high crime societies\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"International tourism leads to both - tension and understanding\n\nI agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.\nThere is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. \nOn the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.\nObviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism.

{"prompt":"Computers replace human teachers\n\nWith the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.\nCentral to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.\nOn the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students.

{"prompt":"Higher education should be available only to good students or not\n\nNo one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.\nFirst of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.\nOn the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.\nIn conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal.

{"prompt":"Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten\n\nEducational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.\nTo begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. \nNevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.\nIn conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 456 548\tit is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten\nT2\tMajorClaim 1870 2000\tif this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children\nT3\tPremise 810 920\tteachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning\nT4\tPremise 966 1077\tthe teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered\nT5\tPremise 707 798\tLearning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to\nT6\tClaim 565 705\tchildren might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years\nT7\tPremise 1116 1199\tkids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years\nT8\tPremise 1201 1257\tThe introduction of foreign language will be new to them\nT9\tPremise 1268 1323\ttheir curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend\nT10\tPremise 1338 1385\tgrasping a new language will be natural to them\nT11\tPremise 1400 1480\tthe positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers\nT12\tPremise 1482 1580\tTeachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years\nT13\tClaim 1609 1692\tthe advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages\nA4\tStance T13 For\nA2\tStance T6 Against\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T13\t\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T13\t\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"should one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style?\n\nWith increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.\nThis is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.\nFurthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.\nDespite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.\nWith those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 433 530\tfashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles\nT2\tMajorClaim 1876 2032\tpeople should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes\nT3\tClaim 2053 2161\tcreative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tClaim 548 741\tfollowing fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 743 983\tWhen individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world\nT6\tPremise 998 1151\tif they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds\nT7\tPremise 1166 1196\tthey might fall behind shortly\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tPremise 1211 1356\tpeople with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information\nT9\tClaim 1358 1501\tWithout following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles\nT10\tPremise 1539 1615\tfollowing fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities\nT11\tPremise 1617 1775\tIndividuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes\nT12\tClaim 1791 1822\tthe world would look monotonous\nA5\tStance T12 Against\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nA3\tStance T9 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Young people move to cities\n\nThese days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.\nTo begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. \nHowever, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.\nIn conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 1472 1521\tyoung people tend to study or work in urban areas\nT2\tPremise 1528 1599\tthese provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nT3\tMajorClaim 1625 1737\tI do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment\nT4\tPremise 376 456\tcities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas\nT5\tClaim 601 709\tthey move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living\nA3\tStance T5 Against\nT6\tPremise 469 589\tmany large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 724 926\tif a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tClaim 1159 1279\tcities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1028 1144\tthe burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1295 1333\tit might put strain on the environment\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT11\tPremise 1335 1455\tIf there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Improve roads or public transports\n\nMany people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.\nFirst, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.\nSecond, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.\nLast but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.\nIn short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 223 299\tgovernments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system\nT2\tClaim 308 386\tit would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 395 485\tthe using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 558 634\tthe more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up\nT5\tPremise 487 545\tCars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 653 765\tif the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower\nT7\tPremise 771 845\tthis definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tClaim 855 918\tpublic transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 931 1005\tpublic transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars\nT10\tPremise 1007 1194\tIt means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT11\tPremise 1216 1285\tusing public transportation is much safer than private transportation\nT12\tPremise 1287 1381\tAccording to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care\nT13\tClaim 1388 1526\tthere is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting\nA5\tStance T13 For\nT14\tMajorClaim 1565 1627\tspending money on improving public transportation is necessary\nT15\tClaim 1636 1733\tit is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in\nA6\tStance T15 For\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Richer nations should help poorer nations in health, education and trade\n\nImprovements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.\nFirstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.\nSecondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.\nLastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading.

{"prompt":"People should have hobbies and do physical activities\n\nWhether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.\nFirst, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.\nAlso, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.\nLast, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured.

{"prompt":"Do guns can really increase the level of violence?\n\nThe number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.\nOn the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.\nOn the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1570 1655\tthe guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence\nT2\tPremise 737 836\tthey have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public\nT3\tClaim 851 965\tsome military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 400 496\ta police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun\nT5\tPremise 498 665\tAn obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him\nT6\tPremise 678 727\tpolice officers can force a criminal to surrender\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tPremise 1085 1191\tthe number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries\nT8\tPremise 1193 1280\tMany well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably\nT9\tPremise 1292 1456\tcost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs\nT10\tPremise 1458 1533\tMany baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance\nT11\tClaim 986 1074\tthere are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities\nA2\tStance T11 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Economic development vs environment\n\nCurrently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.\nAdmittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.\nHowever, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.\nFurthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.\nTherefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 313 386\tflourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation\nT2\tMajorClaim 2065 2149\tthriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously\nT3\tPremise 834 948\tunchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources\nT4\tPremise 711 819\tpeople in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tClaim 964 1036\tthe economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting\nA1\tStance T5 Against\nT6\tPremise 400 517\tsome countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments\nT7\tPremise 627 700\tthey have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tPremise 522 625\tthese needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tClaim 1057 1137\tthe booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment\nA2\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1139 1375\tWith people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales\nT11\tPremise 1390 1496\telectronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nT12\tPremise 1766 1802\tit may spur its economic development\nT13\tPremise 1589 1753\tIf a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tClaim 1511 1587\ttaking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies\nA3\tStance T14 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nT15\tPremise 1823 2030\twithout the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Way to reduce the amount of traffic?\n\nBig cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.\nFirst of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.\nSecond, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.\nIn conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1556 1648\tcity planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas\nT2\tPremise 541 676\tBuses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options\nT3\tPremise 690 802\ta bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number\nT4\tPremise 952 1010\tthey will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays\nT5\tClaim 458 539\tpublic transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 804 940\tNot to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 1282 1439\thuge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities\nT8\tClaim 1441 1539\tThe city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people\nA3\tStance T8 For\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tPremise 1099 1260\tif some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose\n\nSome people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.\nFirst of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.\nSecondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.\nLast but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. \nIn conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives.

{"prompt":"Advertising impact on people's choice of consumption\n\nNowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.\nIn addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.\nHowever, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.\nIn my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tPremise 313 591\tin most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs\nT2\tClaim 208 298\tpeople will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life\nT3\tMajorClaim 1691 1771\tbuying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT4\tClaim 1893 2074\tit is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 1777 1888\tfor children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 892 1045\tthere are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it\nT7\tClaim 756 886\tA good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society\nA3\tStance T7 Against\nT8\tPremise 606 754\tproducts usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T1 Arg2:T2\t\nT9\tClaim 1112 1169\tthe advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy\nA4\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1171 1233\tsometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption\nT11\tPremise 1056 1110\tbuying habit is a very personal things for individuals\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT12\tPremise 1235 1334\tIt is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income\nT13\tPremise 1336 1404\tMost of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase\nT14\tClaim 1425 1573\tchildren and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not\nA5\tStance T14 Against\nT15\tPremise 1581 1666\tthey do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own\n\nDifferent people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.\nA good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.\nThere are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.\nThere are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes.

{"prompt":"Zoos have no useful purpose?\n\nHave you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.\nWhen people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. \nAnimals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. \nFinally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.\nThe reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 365 471\tzoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding\nT2\tMajorClaim 2755 2775\tzoos are very useful\nT3\tClaim 2479 2585\tin some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 2587 2649\tThis is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tClaim 876 1037\tThe zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 473 592\tWhen people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity\nT7\tPremise 594 780\tIn the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs\nT8\tPremise 782 874\tNowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nT9\tPremise 1040 1151\tAnimals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities\nT10\tClaim 1808 1885\tVisiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1153 1278\tWe can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience\nT12\tPremise 1280 1441\tIf you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have\nT13\tPremise 1443 1557\tIn the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult\nT14\tPremise 1559 1735\tIt offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies\nT15\tPremise 1747 1806\tit will also help identify which animals could be dangerous\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nT16\tClaim 1897 1983\ta visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals\nA3\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 2263 2427\tBeing able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve\nT18\tPremise 1985 2071\tIt is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it\nT19\tPremise 2073 2206\tThis is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs\nT20\tPremise 2208 2261\tIn the present there is a lack of respect for animals\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T16\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T16\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The car use will definitely decrease in twenty years\n\nViews differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.\nFirst of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. \nSecond, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.\nAlthough, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.\nIn conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 501 551\tthere will be a decrease in cars use in the future\nT2\tMajorClaim 2294 2346\tthe car use will definitely decrease in twenty years\nT3\tPremise 619 657\tthe public transportation has improved\nT4\tClaim 659 707\tit is much convenience to take a subway or a bus\nA1\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 722 827\tI live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars\nT6\tPremise 833 935\twith the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own\nT7\tClaim 1017 1130\twith the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 946 1011\ta driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world\nT9\tPremise 1145 1314\tinstead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city\nT10\tClaim 1542 1572\ta personal car uses is in need\nA3\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tPremise 1581 1627\ta public transportation can't meet every place\nT12\tPremise 1640 1729\tit may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places\nT13\tPremise 1740 1933\tno matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet\nT14\tPremise 1935 2008\tIt not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health\nT15\tPremise 2023 2053\tthis won't be a problem at all\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages\n\nWomen or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. \nSchool is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. \nMoreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. \nIn a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages.

{"prompt":"Children engagement in paid work\n\nIn many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.\nFirst of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.\nSecondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.\nSome people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.\nIn conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 345 416\tthe benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks\nT2\tMajorClaim 1581 1724\tif children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible\nT3\tClaim 730 846\tthey are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 432 486\tchildren can learn about the hardship of earning money\nT5\tPremise 488 717\tWhen they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life\nT6\tClaim 858 914\twhen children take jobs, they tend to be more responsibl\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 924 1018\twhether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working\nT8\tPremise 1020 1099\tTo keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties\nT9\tPremise 1114 1267\tif a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost\nT10\tClaim 1296 1398\tchildren will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers\nA3\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tPremise 1409 1564\tif children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Early retirement for 55+ employees to help younger people\n\nNowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.\nAdmittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.\nHowever, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.\nIn conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1798 1927\tit would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly\nT2\tPremise 633 724\tthey have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities\nT3\tPremise 491 615\tfresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation\nT4\tPremise 736 833\thaving a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency\nT5\tPremise 835 991\tCompared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline\nT6\tClaim 361 480\tencouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits\nA1\tStance T6 Against\nT7\tClaim 1716 1774\tthe introduction of the early retirement has some benefits\nA2\tStance T7 Against\nT8\tPremise 1376 1496\tFrom social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government\nT9\tPremise 1511 1687\tsufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently\nT10\tClaim 1002 1092\tsacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1094 1189\tFrom personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations\nT12\tPremise 1213 1374\tevery person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Which is better- Learning foreign language in home or host country?\n\nOur World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.\nFirst of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.\nSecond, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country.

{"prompt":"Should universities accept equal number of males\/females or not\n\nEducation is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.\nRight to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.\nCo-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.\nUnfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.\nThus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 324 397\tUniversities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices\nT2\tMajorClaim 1686 1769\tboth genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers\nT3\tClaim 1771 1832\tEquality in education will help in development of the society\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 1834 1918\tBoth genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tClaim 534 586\tfemales should be given equal opportunities as males\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 469 511\tThe whole world aims for women empowerment\nT7\tPremise 399 467\tRight to education is a basic human right of both, males and females\nT8\tPremise 588 740\tWhen universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nT9\tClaim 1134 1257\tUniversities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 742 801\tCo-education helps both genders to gel well with each other\nT11\tPremise 803 862\tIt helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together\nT12\tPremise 877 985\tstudents studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them\nT13\tPremise 1006 1066\tfemales studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys\nT14\tPremise 1068 1132\tCo-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nT15\tClaim 1274 1396\tsome male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc\nA4\tStance T15 Against\nT16\tPremise 1398 1483\tThis kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society\nT17\tPremise 1501 1546\twomen have proved their mettle in every field\nT18\tPremise 1548 1656\tWomen like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills\nR10\tattacks Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should people be forced to stop working?\n\nThe appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.\nFirst and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.\nApart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.\nAdmittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.\nIn conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 299 365\tthe right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old\nT2\tMajorClaim 379 478\tstrongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age\nT3\tPremise 550 659\tif senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates\nT4\tClaim 674 773\tmost of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nT5\tPremise 803 1060\ta medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available\nT6\tPremise 1078 1247\tdue to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace\nT7\tClaim 1803 1892\tit would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1266 1309\tnot all elderly workers are physically well\nT9\tPremise 1311 1485\tBeyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses\nT10\tPremise 1507 1594\tthe stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him\nT11\tPremise 1610 1677\tthey will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing\nT12\tPremise 1688 1795\tthe academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT13\tMajorClaim 2370 2434\tit is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement\nT14\tClaim 1906 1988\tthe expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated\nA3\tStance T14 Against\nT15\tPremise 1990 2152\tTheir invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation\nT16\tPremise 2161 2353\tit is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nA4\tStance T4 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Capital punishment is necessary or not?\n\nCapital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, \"murdering\" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.\nFirst of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.\nSecondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.\nThe third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.\nIn conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 323 384\t\"murdering\" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept\nT2\tMajorClaim 1700 1725\tit is absurd and inhumane\nT3\tClaim 1605 1668\tcapital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tClaim 422 514\tevery human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 525 624\twhat criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive\nT6\tPremise 626 675\tthey are humans and their lives need to be valued\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT7\tPremise 690 742\texecution does not resolve the consequences of crime\nT8\tPremise 759 869\tit could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 881 1069\tcapital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives\nT10\tPremise 1081 1288\tin terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away\nA3\tStance T9 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tClaim 1290 1402\tThe third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted\nA4\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1463 1579\tmany people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system\nT13\tPremise 1404 1455\tJuries are also humans, they may lack of discretion\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nT14\tClaim 1740 1777\tit can be replaced by a life sentence\nA5\tStance T14 For\n"}
{"prompt":"I believe it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community\n\nI believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.\nIn the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.\nFurthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.\nLastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 94 161\tit is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community\nT3\tPremise 213 323\tthe establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping\nT4\tPremise 353 562\tQueens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose\nT5\tPremise 590 640\tit is one of the most productive malls in New York\nT6\tPremise 655 751\tI could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there\nT7\tClaim 779 870\ta large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time\nA2\tStance T7 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tClaim 885 948\tit not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 950 1053\tThere may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1055 1147\tIt could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job\nT11\tPremise 1149 1249\tSome students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nT2\tClaim 1259 1371\tit is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand\nA4\tStance T2 For\nT12\tPremise 1373 1482\tThere may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers\nT13\tPremise 1497 1604\twith sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy\nT14\tPremise 1619 1740\tthe residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T2\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T2\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T2\t\nT15\tMajorClaim 1775 1878\tI advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Professors should do more research or teach students?\n\nThese days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.\nFirst of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.\nSecondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. \nLast but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. \nFor those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 299 352\tprofessors should be encouraged to mainly do research\nT2\tMajorClaim 2030 2106\tit is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research\nT3\tClaim 2108 2224\tWhile extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 554 649\tby doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies\nT5\tPremise 479 539\tThe research projects provide communication with the outside\nT6\tPremise 368 429\tdoing research is a method of self-improvement for professors\nT7\tPremise 431 477\tUniversities are relatively fenced environment\nT8\tPremise 651 748\tI still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college\nT9\tPremise 750 805\tHe was often invited to do speech in other universities\nT10\tPremise 816 903\tmy university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects\nT11\tClaim 905 965\tThe research projects like windows opened to the wider world\nA2\tStance T11 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T11\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T11\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T11\t\nT12\tPremise 1141 1219\tyou could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together\nT13\tPremise 1235 1313\tthere is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages\nT14\tPremise 1065 1133\tIt is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tPremise 1315 1420\tWe all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin\nT16\tPremise 1422 1480\tUniversities positively contribute the professors' success\nT17\tClaim 977 1063\tprofessors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities\nA3\tStance T17 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T17\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T17\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T17\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\nT18\tClaim 1503 1557\tdoing research could also improve the teaching quality\nA4\tStance T18 For\nT19\tPremise 1559 1675\tWith the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom\nT20\tPremise 1677 1746\tThey can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice\nT21\tPremise 1748 1845\tI still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project\nT22\tPremise 1847 1944\tBy participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments\nT23\tPremise 1946 2008\tThe research project provides a more efficient way of teaching\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T18\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T18\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T18\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T18\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Mobile phone; \"Iron man\" \/ \"Weichat\" - destroy social interactions?\n\nRecently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.\nIn the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.\nFurthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as \"Iron man\". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.\nHowever, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet.

{"prompt":"Spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life\n\nDespite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.\nThe first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. \nOf course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.\nAnother reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.\nWhen you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.\nIn sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 257 315\tother prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends\nT2\tMajorClaim 1873 1944\tspending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life\nT3\tClaim 384 498\tstaying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 514 759\tamong a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before\nT5\tClaim 1121 1244\ta large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 1259 1475\tif you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages\nT7\tClaim 1477 1614\tWhen you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more\nA3\tStance T7 Against\nT8\tPremise 1638 1733\tthey often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience\nT9\tClaim 773 897\twhile differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement\nA4\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 899 1011\tThis would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends\nT11\tPremise 1022 1096\tin this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Parents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else\n\nI completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.\nFirstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him\/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.\nSecondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him\/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. \nLastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.\nAll in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 105 133\tparents are the best teacher\nT2\tClaim 135 267\tChildren normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 278 337\tthe things that parents say have great power to their child\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 339 391\tMore power than any friend or other adult could have\nT5\tPremise 406 616\tif someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him\/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tPremise 628 703\ta child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people\nT7\tClaim 708 771\ttheir parents have more time to teach him\/her than anybody else\nA4\tStance T7 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 773 833\tThey have more contact and more intimacy with their children\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tPremise 931 1051\teven if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves\nT10\tPremise 1057 1173\tif there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad\nT11\tClaim 844 895\tchildren usually mirror themselves on their parents\nA3\tStance T11 Against\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nT12\tMajorClaim 1200 1233\tparents are the greatest teachers\n"}
{"prompt":"Creative Artists\n\nInnovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.\nOne of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.\nLet's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.\nBy way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 265 406\tfreedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create\nT2\tMajorClaim 2051 2110\tthey should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas\nT3\tClaim 2113 2159\tthis world needs them to make itself colourful\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 408 546\tOne of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society\nA2\tStance T4 Against\nT5\tPremise 567 668\tthe audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work\nT6\tPremise 697 917\tart inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning\nT7\tPremise 919 1062\tIf the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value\nT8\tPremise 1286 1348\tthe notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tattacks Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 1566 1618\trestrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1444 1540\tsome of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc\nT11\tPremise 1622 1699\tadolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents\nT12\tPremise 1710 1934\tin the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Cheap air travel should be encouraged?\n\nIn recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.\nIt is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.\nOn the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. \nIn conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 204 252\tthere are good arguments in favour of this trend\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nT2\tMajorClaim 299 341\tcheap flight can make many serious problem\nT3\tMajorClaim 1366 1420\tthe drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits\nT4\tClaim 365 473\tcheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 475 554\tThese days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure\nT6\tPremise 556 679\tThey can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds\nT7\tClaim 691 805\ttravels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tClaim 826 893\tgrowing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment\nA4\tStance T8 Against\nT9\tPremise 907 1033\tmore flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it\nT10\tPremise 1044 1095\tthe biggest concern is the effect on global warming\nT11\tPremise 1097 1192\tBurning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT12\tPremise 1203 1329\twhile many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Technology inspires children's creativity instead of weakening it\n\nTechnology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.\nFirst, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.\nSecond, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.\nAdmittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 564 608\ttechnology makes children even more creative\nT2\tClaim 497 550\ttechnology may have some negative effects on children\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tClaim 1828 1876\ttechnology may have negative effects on children\nA2\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 1878 1929\tTechnology has made life too easy for most children\nT5\tPremise 1931 2038\tIn comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change\nT6\tPremise 617 666\ttechnology inspires children to create new things\nT7\tPremise 1290 1327\ttechnology widen children's knowledge\nT8\tPremise 722 864\twhen they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works\nT9\tPremise 668 717\tChildren are curious about everything around them\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 879 994\tBill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked\nT11\tPremise 996 1073\tAfter he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer\nT12\tPremise 1075 1159\tIn the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight\nT13\tClaim 1172 1280\tinstead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create\nA5\tStance T13 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T13\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nT14\tPremise 1329 1400\tIn the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective\nT15\tPremise 1558 1640\tthey will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking\nT16\tPremise 1411 1545\twith highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nT17\tPremise 1642 1677\tKnowledge is the base of creativity\nT18\tClaim 1679 1814\tThe diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things\nA6\tStance T18 For\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T18\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T18\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T18\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T18\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT19\tMajorClaim 2161 2239\tThey kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age\nT20\tPremise 2053 2159\twith the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products\nR18\tattacks Arg1:T20 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T13\t\n"}

On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.\nAs illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.\nIn conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 371 441\tit is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems\nT2\tMajorClaim 1959 2043\taddressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate\nT3\tPremise 670 762\twhether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated\nT4\tPremise 528 659\tprice control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area\nT5\tClaim 900 952\tit seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 777 884\tgovernments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands\nT7\tPremise 973 1110\tpollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution\nT8\tPremise 1125 1252\tthe improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nT9\tClaim 1277 1371\tseveral other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems\nA1\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1384 1550\tauthorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars\nT11\tPremise 1565 1695\ttemporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season\nT12\tPremise 1702 1766\twith supervisory institutions built to find and address problems\nT13\tPremise 1779 1942\tcultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"True function of a university\n\nUniversities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.\nA university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.\nOn the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.\nIn conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T3\tClaim 706 795\tA university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge\nT4\tPremise 827 904\tstudents are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers\nT5\tPremise 955 1207\tHigh school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field\nT6\tPremise 909 953\tstudents are the ones here to seek knowledge\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT2\tMajorClaim 1683 1778\tthe main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources\nT7\tClaim 1542 1666\ta university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1228 1313\tuniversities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather\nT9\tPremise 1315 1488\tIt is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nA3\tStance T3 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Benefits of students' unpaid work\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.\nTo begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.\nAs for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.\nTo sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T2\tClaim 388 506\tstudents can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 649 772\tstudents might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation\nT4\tPremise 508 634\tIn most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 791 880\tthe internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy\nT6\tPremise 882 951\tAs for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money\nT1\tClaim 1295 1383\tcompanies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation\nA4\tStance T1 For\nT7\tPremise 1213 1282\tthey can start looking for potential employees and begin the training\nT8\tPremise 966 1202\tthe younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T1\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T1\t\nT9\tMajorClaim 1396 1677\tstudents can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T1\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country\n\nEducation is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.\nIn a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.\nDevelopment through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.\nIn conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country.

{"prompt":"Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages\n\nIn the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.\nNo one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.\nAdmittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.\nIn conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 226 265\tit's a reasonable loss in globalization\nT2\tMajorClaim 1583 1691\tI'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around\nT3\tClaim 362 451\tNo one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 468 530\tcommunication between countries and cultures become convenient\nT5\tPremise 532 598\tIn my country, English is a required course from elementary school\nT6\tPremise 606 662\tstudying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 674 810\tlanguage obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country\nT8\tPremise 827 884\tenhances relationship and promotes international business\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tPremise 899 1016\tresearchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English\nT10\tPremise 1018 1098\tTaking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English\nT11\tPremise 1100 1199\tIt's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides\nT12\tPremise 1214 1275\tthey have no choice but choosing English as a second language\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T3\t\nT13\tClaim 1383 1430\tthe culture heritage and nation identity vanish\nA2\tStance T13 Against\nT14\tPremise 1314 1374\tEnglish is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tPremise 1441 1531\tthis is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society\nR11\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Advertisements affects on consumer goods\n\nEveryday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. \nWe are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. \nAlso, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised.

{"prompt":"Question about the influence of the media coverage of celebrities\n\nToday, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.\nFame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.\nOn the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor\/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.\nIn conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1501 1591\tparents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'\nT2\tClaim 799 849\tchildren may see that this behavior is inexcusable\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 686 786\tcelebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace\nT4\tPremise 575 668\tCelebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively\nT5\tClaim 870 998\ttoo much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 1000 1151\tAs recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor\/actress or a sports star than it was in the past\nT7\tPremise 1153 1332\tMany schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable\nT8\tPremise 1334 1484\tThis may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nT9\tPremise 461 573\tFame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T2\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Going to classes should be optional for the students\n\nUniversity students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.\nTo begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.\nAdditionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth.

{"prompt":"Learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself.\n\nEvery person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. \nFirstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. \nSecondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.\nFinally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising.

{"prompt":"A single international language or not?\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.\nIt is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.\nAlso, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.\nIn spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.\nTherefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 238 357\ta universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people\nT2\tPremise 410 493\ta single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation\nT3\tClaim 904 962\ta single international language serves an economic purpose\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 495 693\tAs businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation\nT5\tPremise 708 891\twithout the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them\nT6\tClaim 970 1053\ta universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions\nA3\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 1055 1327\tIf people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles\nT8\tPremise 1342 1557\twhen people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience\nT9\tMajorClaim 2216 2327\ta single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication\nT10\tClaim 2348 2438\tevery country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage\nA4\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tClaim 1675 1767\ta single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation\nA5\tStance T11 Against\nT12\tPremise 1785 1903\tpeople may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong\nT13\tPremise 1919 1999\tsome Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries\nT14\tPremise 2022 2181\tthey have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\n"}

Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. \nMoreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.\nIn conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health.

{"prompt":"People should create a sense of co-operation in their children\n\nIt is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:\nCompetitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.\nHowever, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.\nIn my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.\nTo conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1724 1830\tpeople should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life\nT2\tPremise 858 1006\tMNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team\nT3\tClaim 409 507\tCompetitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 737 801\tThis factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 1173 1256\tthey will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do\nT6\tClaim 1262 1349\tthey shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team\nR3\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 1017 1161\tthose who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead\nA2\tStance T6 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 1373 1476\tcompetitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level\nT9\tClaim 1571 1692\tco-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1482 1546\tit will not help them to be on the success path for the long run\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Protect animals or not?\n \nMany animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.\nAnimal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.\nHowever, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.\nFurthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help.

In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.\nOn the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills.

{"prompt":"Tourism: good or bad?\n\nTourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.\nFirst of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.\nSecondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild.

{"prompt":"Every experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life\n\nI agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.\nThe best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.\nAll inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.\nOur difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. \nTherefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 266 366\texperience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life\nT2\tClaim 541 648\tthose challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life\nT3\tPremise 464 521\tEvery day comes with new challenges for them like walking\nA1\tStance T2 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tPremise 663 740\twhen they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times\nT5\tPremise 746 798\tthey slowly tune their technique and learned to walk\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tPremise 875 922\tNo known scientist has success in first attempt\nT7\tPremise 924 988\tScientists try and test many specimens before they get they want\nT8\tPremise 1007 1074\tThomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb\nT9\tPremise 1080 1301\tall the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through\nT10\tClaim 800 873\tAll inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations\nA2\tStance T10 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nT11\tPremise 1647 1720\tfirst time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known\nT12\tPremise 1722 1855\tI had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them\nT13\tPremise 1857 1982\tI also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills\nT14\tPremise 1551 1638\tWhen I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me\nT15\tPremise 1373 1549\tWe might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves\nT16\tClaim 1303 1371\tOur difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly\nA3\tStance T16 For\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T16\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T16\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T16\t\nT17\tMajorClaim 2063 2166\tevery experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life\nT18\tClaim 2168 2245\tGood experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life\nA4\tStance T18 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people\n\nAlthough developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.\nFirst, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.\nSecond, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.\nLastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.\nIn conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 352 414\tgovernment should pay attention on basic needs of people first\nT2\tClaim 760 804\tgovernment should invest to create more jobs\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 806 861\tWhen people have jobs, they did not have to steal money\nT4\tPremise 874 897\tcriminal rate were drop\nT5\tPremise 905 936\tpeople have a good quality life\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tPremise 691 749\tquality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy\nT7\tPremise 622 675\tThere were increasing in criminal rate in many cities\nT8\tPremise 560 620\tWhen people did not have money, They had to rob other people\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT9\tPremise 443 520\tafter great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T2\t\nT10\tPremise 1019 1124\tindustrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect\nT11\tPremise 1126 1168\tGreenhouse effect causes of climate change\nT12\tPremise 1170 1220\tThese impact on every living creature in the world\nT13\tPremise 1226 1318\tgovernment take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide\nT14\tClaim 1372 1468\tgovernment should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy\nA3\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1470 1527\tIf we lived in good environment, our life would be better\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nT16\tPremise 946 1008\tenvironment is also important issue that everyone depend on it\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nT17\tClaim 1788 1844\tgovernment should create campaign to fill love to family\nA2\tStance T17 For\nT18\tPremise 1859 1943\tsetting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other\nT19\tPremise 1945 2035\tWhen family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nT20\tPremise 1537 1564\tfamily is a root of society\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T17\t\nT21\tPremise 1566 1724\tIf everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T17\t\nT22\tPremise 1726 1780\tWhen society had problems, it could impact to a nation\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T17\t\nT23\tMajorClaim 2091 2142\tgovernment should spend money on basic people needs\nT24\tClaim 2205 2356\tThese three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people\nA4\tStance T24 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Successful people try new things and take risks\n\nI have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.\nThere are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. \nI do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.\nIn sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 325 410\tsuccessful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things\nT2\tClaim 437 478\tgreat success requires taking great risks\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1698 1808\tsuccess and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them\nA2\tStance T1 For\nT4\tPremise 610 757\tif you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places\nT5\tPremise 759 870\tBy selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities\nT6\tPremise 887 969\tyou will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future\nT7\tClaim 971 1065\tThese experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 480 595\tThere are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tPremise 1129 1324\tIf you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money\nT10\tPremise 1326 1486\tIf you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies\nT11\tPremise 1488 1547\tThe more you take risks, the greater your successes will be\nT12\tClaim 1644 1673\tit is important to take risks\nA5\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1549 1631\tIf you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes\nT14\tPremise 1086 1127\tgreat success requires taking great risks\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should animals be free or live in zoos?\n\nMany people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.\nMany scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. \nIn addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 206 279\twe must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment\nT2\tMajorClaim 1347 1422\twe have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible\nT3\tClaim 1424 1491\tScientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 1503 1564\tmany zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tClaim 281 365\tMany scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 376 457\tlike we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts\nT7\tPremise 524 661\tWhen we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts\nT8\tPremise 670 805\twhen they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nT9\tClaim 843 940\tvarious zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care\nA4\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1003 1058\tI was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated\nT11\tPremise 1060 1166\tI can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo\nT12\tPremise 1168 1185\tThey beat them up\nT13\tPremise 1194 1306\tthey did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary?\n\nProfessional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.\nFirst of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his\/her competence and value on his\/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.\nSecond, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. \nSome people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his\/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.\nIn conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 400 433\tthey do deserve this high payment\nT2\tClaim 547 647\tthose who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 449 534\ta worker's salary can properly reflect his\/her competence and value on his\/her career\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tPremise 649 680\tThey are not paid for no reason\nT5\tPremise 682 828\tAs we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment\nT6\tPremise 830 867\tIt's all the same in every profession\nT7\tPremise 880 998\tthe richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T2\t\nT8\tClaim 1008 1090\tsuch high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1092 1260\tMost of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves\nT10\tPremise 1262 1304\tThey shall reap within their high salaries\nT11\tPremise 1322 1464\tif they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tClaim 1496 1585\tthe gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair\nA3\tStance T12 Against\nT13\tPremise 1611 1705\tas long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his\/her dreams and careers, that would be fair\nT14\tPremise 1707 1818\tFairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT15\tMajorClaim 1835 1968\thigh salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances\nT16\tClaim 1970 2129\tIt is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy\nA4\tStance T16 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect\n\nIn this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.\nFirst of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.\nSecondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.\nThird, the campaigns might include practical benefits.

{"prompt":"Are museums necessary?\n\nI believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.\nMost people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.\nIn order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you \"visit\" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.\nSeeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.\nIn conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 34 90\tpublic museums and art galleries will still be necessary\nT2\tClaim 104 158\twe can see the art works and historical objects online\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 239 282\tthe Internet really brings them convenience\nT4\tPremise 401 450\tpictures online are only limited to a screen size\nT5\tPremise 465 562\tthe exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling\nT6\tMajorClaim 1578 1617\twe still need museums and art galleries\nT7\tClaim 1622 1755\tcomputers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects\nA2\tStance T7 Against\nT8\tPremise 577 636\tonly when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique\nT9\tClaim 160 230\tMost people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work\nA3\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 284 342\tWe can browse the art work from all over the world at home\nT11\tPremise 353 394\tpeople may not get a spiritual experience\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T11\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T9\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nT12\tClaim 638 781\tIn order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 796 903\tat American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus\nT14\tPremise 905 1006\tat Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music\nT15\tPremise 1008 1095\tWhile if you \"visit\" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nT16\tClaim 1097 1183\tSeeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes\nA5\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 1199 1302\tyou can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist\nT18\tPremise 1317 1387\tnot all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen\nT19\tPremise 1389 1414\tSome details might be dim\nT20\tPremise 1421 1474\tthe resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T19\t\nT21\tPremise 1476 1551\tThese may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T16\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards other people\n\nPeople should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. \nFirstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. \nSecondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. \nThirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.\nNobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 411 467\tpeople should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy\nT2\tMajorClaim 1828 1988\tthere are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live\nT3\tPremise 716 822\thousework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility\nT4\tPremise 824 876\tI really don't like any of them, however I should do\nT5\tClaim 572 700\tIn personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities\nA1\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 502 571\tmost people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tClaim 888 965\tprofessional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1061 1307\tI'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field\nT9\tPremise 967 1059\tNobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT10\tPremise 1391 1502\tPeople sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want\nT11\tPremise 1517 1604\tone of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like\nT12\tPremise 1606 1789\tAfter insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month\nT13\tClaim 1319 1389\tdoing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment\nA3\tStance T13 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"High schools must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum\n\nSome people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.\nTo begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.\nNext, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.\nLast but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.\nIn summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 231 309\tstudents should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics\nT2\tClaim 326 406\ttertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 421 504\tit should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tMajorClaim 1831 1952\tstudents should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education\nT5\tClaim 521 606\tstudents have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 608 753\tThey should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject\nT7\tPremise 769 873\ta would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tPremise 881 947\tstudents should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields\nT9\tPremise 949 1016\tGeneral education plays a significant role in specialized education\nT10\tPremise 1018 1181\tScience today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics\nT11\tPremise 1205 1332\ttextbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects\nT12\tPremise 1348 1418\tyou sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tClaim 1431 1514\thigh school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university\nA5\tStance T13 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nT14\tClaim 1754 1817\tschools should be responsible for their future and protect them\nA6\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1536 1579\tstudents have tendency to shun difficulties\nT16\tPremise 1581 1689\tThey might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much\nT17\tPremise 1691 1741\tThis might result in limited choices in the future\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Learning to be independent is essential for young adults\n\nLearning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.\nFirst of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.\nFurthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.\nThe third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.\nTo sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 211 308\tstaying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult\nT2\tMajorClaim 1924 1970\tstaying longer with parents is a better choice\nT3\tClaim 1818 1915\tliving with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 469 526\tthe young adult can have more experience with his parents\nT5\tClaim 879 916\tundergoing with parents is worthwhile\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 528 611\tThe young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age\nT7\tPremise 613 682\tWhen having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown\nT8\tPremise 684 805\tIf he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together\nT9\tPremise 807 863\tAll memories become priceless treasure as time passes by\nT10\tPremise 1064 1140\the may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents\nT11\tPremise 1152 1208\tanother daily expense is also the considerable outgoings\nT12\tPremise 1210 1292\tSpending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be\nT13\tClaim 1305 1372\tthe parents can save money, if their children live with them longer\nT14\tPremise 931 976\tliving at home costs less than living outside\nT15\tPremise 978 1051\tLearning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home\nT16\tPremise 1410 1463\tthe young adult needs father and mother's suggestions\nT17\tPremise 1465 1533\tWhen in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand\nT18\tPremise 1535 1642\tThey are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way\nT19\tPremise 1644 1721\tIf the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain\nT20\tClaim 1730 1805\ttaking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily\nA2\tStance T20 For\nA4\tStance T13 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T20\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T20\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T20\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T20\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should professors doing more research or educating students more?\n\nAlthough professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.\nA professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him\/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.\nAs for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.\nFinally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.\nIn conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university.

{"prompt":"Whether athletes and singers are overpaid?\n\nSome people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.\nFirst of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. \nHowever, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life.

Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.\nFrom all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions.

{"prompt":"Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion\n\nRecently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.\nFirstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.\nSecondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.\nIn order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.\nIn summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 358 464\talternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced\nT2\tMajorClaim 2393 2565\talternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion\nT3\tClaim 2325 2372\tsome people claim the convenience of automobile\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tClaim 822 933\tit is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 561 638\tan increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution\nT6\tPremise 646 721\tautomobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air\nT7\tPremise 723 809\tthe air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tClaim 1221 1351\tthe methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 945 1020\tan increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion\nT10\tPremise 1022 1098\tOnce we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while\nT11\tPremise 1115 1213\ttraffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tPremise 1536 1623\talternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal\nT13\tPremise 1638 1709\trental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries\nT14\tPremise 1711 1860\tThis system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee\nT15\tPremise 1868 1925\tbicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses\nT16\tPremise 1927 1985\tit is a better form to protect environment than automobile\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T16\t\nT17\tClaim 1387 1507\talternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively\nA4\tStance T17 For\nT18\tPremise 2207 2299\tthese attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T12\t\nT19\tPremise 2012 2072\tthe introduction of international laws can be also effective\nT20\tPremise 2088 2199\tthere are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T19\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T17\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T19\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Non academic subjects should be removed from syllabus\n\nStudents have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.\nTo begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.\nIn addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.\nSome people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2039 2079\tschools should not remove these subjects\nT2\tClaim 1939 2026\tnon-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 354 434\tfrom the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects\nT4\tPremise 436 551\tIf physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health\nT5\tPremise 567 814\tafter studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes\nT6\tClaim 816 962\tRemoving physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability\nT7\tClaim 1349 1428\tschool education should not only focus on the academic development of a student\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1432 1512\tit is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life\nT9\tPremise 1145 1341\tSuccess in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit\nT10\tPremise 977 1055\tschools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people\nT11\tPremise 1057 1143\tIt is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically\nT12\tClaim 1541 1614\tstudents can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents\nA4\tStance T12 Against\nT13\tPremise 1640 1661\tit is not a good idea\nT14\tPremise 1670 1796\tmost young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents\nT15\tPremise 1808 1898\tparents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills\nT16\tMajorClaim 256 337\tnon-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that\nA5\tStance T6 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Famous people are bothered by the media\n\nSome people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. \nOne reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. \nAnother reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like \"Big Brother\".\nTo sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 365 413\tmass media deal too much with superficial things\nT2\tMajorClaim 1428 1688\ttelevision, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV\nT3\tPremise 565 661\tGutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs\nT4\tPremise 663 758\tThanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world\nT5\tPremise 773 883\tmass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nT6\tClaim 457 563\ttelevision and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership\nA1\tStance T6 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 987 1104\tNowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training\nT8\tClaim 909 985\twe live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1106 1241\tNewspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos\nT10\tPremise 1257 1398\tthere are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like \"Big Brother\"\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Students should be required to take regular standardized tests\n\nThe issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.\nFirstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.\nAdditionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.\nFinally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.\nUltimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 255 403\tstandardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge\nT2\tMajorClaim 1822 1896\tschools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right\nT3\tClaim 1934 2033\tthese schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 637 721\texams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students\nT5\tClaim 414 447\tstandardized tests are preferable\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT7\tPremise 530 624\tsome students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue\nT8\tPremise 736 803\tmany teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class\nT9\tPremise 808 871\tthe usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them\nT6\tPremise 983 1065\tsome students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard\nT10\tPremise 1070 1120\tthey will never try to solve problems on their own\nT11\tPremise 1131 1172\tstandardized tests offer them such chance\nT12\tClaim 1197 1299\tschools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides\nA2\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 887 974\tstandardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice\nT14\tClaim 1323 1381\trequirement to take standardized tests is the right choice\nA4\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1389 1467\tin this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students\nT16\tPremise 1469 1594\tIn any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively\nT17\tPremise 1639 1691\tstandardized tests are required over those who don’t\nT18\tPremise 1700 1797\tif the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them\nT19\tPremise 469 516\tthey help teachers to fairly grade the students\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T5\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Old and young workers\n\nThroughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.\nFirst and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.\nSecondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.\nLast but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages.

I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. \nFirst, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions.

As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.\nTaking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.\nEntertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.\nFurthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.\nTo summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 213 321\tgovernment should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities\nT2\tMajorClaim 1916 2026\tbudgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities\nT3\tClaim 2036 2147\tthe former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 758 846\tproviding education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 398 543\tTaking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums\nT6\tPremise 566 745\tan uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT7\tClaim 848 944\tEntertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 946 1058\tTheir existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience\nT9\tPremise 1060 1193\tThe competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government\nT10\tPremise 1204 1393\tthe establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nT11\tPremise 1593 1698\tit is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs\nT12\tClaim 1723 1799\tsectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1809 1878\tthey are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis\nT14\tPremise 1408 1511\tputting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them\nT15\tPremise 1526 1580\tnot everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Popularity of mobile phones to young people\n\nNowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.\nFirst of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.\nSecondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. \nThis clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 308 384\tthe popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development\nT2\tMajorClaim 1701 1802\tthe negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character\nT3\tClaim 400 524\tmany young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 526 673\tGames and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities\nT5\tPremise 686 825\tinternet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works\nT6\tPremise 827 905\tIn my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone\nT7\tPremise 907 992\tI have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends\nT8\tPremise 994 1110\tThat goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 1122 1203\tjuveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic\nA2\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1205 1293\tThey would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand\nT11\tPremise 1417 1493\tthey would need their parents to support them financially for what they want\nT12\tPremise 1377 1413\tmost of these juveniles are students\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tPremise 1495 1674\tAn illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9\t\nT14\tPremise 1307 1362\tthese do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance.\n\nGetting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.\nTo begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.\nAdditionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.\nFinally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.\nIn conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 423 474\tstudents should be asked to evaluate their teachers\nT2\tMajorClaim 2085 2138\tschool should ask students to evaluate their teachers\nT3\tClaim 2147 2187\tteachers could improve their performance\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tMajorClaim 2365 2426\tthere are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers\nT5\tClaim 2199 2237\tschools are also improve their quality\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 2246 2281\tthey have high performance teachers\nT7\tPremise 2296 2342\tstudents are easy to understand their subjects\nT8\tClaim 976 1036\tevaluating from students could improve teachers' performance\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 491 563\tEvaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance\nT10\tPremise 578 710\tevaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product\nT11\tPremise 712 819\tStudents might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information\nT12\tPremise 835 963\tteachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give\nT13\tPremise 1462 1552\tschool have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students\nT14\tPremise 1272 1348\tin many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products\nT15\tPremise 1357 1408\tthey have employees whose performance are very high\nT16\tPremise 1410 1453\tSchools could produce intellectual students\nT17\tPremise 1114 1150\tTeachers could augment their quality\nT18\tPremise 1166 1256\tWhen school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality\nT20\tClaim 1052 1112\tthis evaluation from students could improve schools' quality\nA6\tStance T20 For\nT21\tPremise 1729 1833\tteachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects\nT22\tPremise 1835 1881\tstudents could comprehend their subject easily\nT23\tPremise 1896 2035\tstudents, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life\nT24\tClaim 1563 1624\tpeople who get the most advantage from evaluation is students\nT25\tPremise 1626 1719\tStudents could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance\nA8\tStance T24 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T16\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T20\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T20\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T20\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T20\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T22\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T25 Arg2:T24\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T24\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T23 Arg2:T24\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Follow the New Customs of the New Country or Not?\n\nWhen people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.\nOn one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.\nOn the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.\nAll in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 386 450\tI would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country\nT2\tMajorClaim 2138 2197\tthe immigrants should follow the customs in the new country\nT3\tClaim 465 558\tit will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 560 689\tWhen people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures\nT5\tPremise 691 802\tThe custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture\nT6\tPremise 817 1027\tif one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture\nT7\tPremise 1042 1111\tpeople understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country\nT8\tClaim 1132 1185\tkeeping own customs stably might cause discrimination\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1187 1326\tWhen people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country\nT10\tPremise 1328 1439\tThe local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society\nT11\tPremise 1441 1512\tOne example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969\nT12\tPremise 1514 1579\tThey formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it\nT13\tPremise 1581 1691\tWhile the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working\nT14\tPremise 1702 1768\tbeing much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination\nT15\tPremise 1770 1827\tTheir houses and private cars were buried by local people\nT16\tPremise 1837 1933\tthe locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs\nT17\tPremise 1935 2124\tIf the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T8\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T8\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T8\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T8\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\n"}

{"prompt":"Under suitable administration, tourism enhances local economic development\n\nTourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.\nThe most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.\nSome people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.\nAfter careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 400 547\tthrough proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas\nT2\tMajorClaim 2168 2242\tthe tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages\nT3\tMajorClaim 2259 2355\tit is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks\nT4\tClaim 549 657\tThe most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region\nA1\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 659 858\tThis takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry\nT6\tPremise 860 1022\tThe increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs\nT7\tPremise 1037 1199\ttourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry\nT8\tPremise 1201 1361\tThis increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes\nT9\tPremise 1376 1463\tthis gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nT10\tClaim 1465 1562\tSome people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism\nA3\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tPremise 1573 1693\tcompared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers\nT12\tPremise 1709 1817\tpaper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution\nR10\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tPremise 1838 1995\tthe dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated\nR12\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nT14\tPremise 1997 2107\tIt is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so\nR13\tattacks Arg1:T14 Arg2:T10\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T4\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The best way of learning life\n\nLife is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.\nOn one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.\nOn the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant.

{"prompt":"Nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use\n\nComputer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. \nI would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.\nHowever, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.\nIn conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life.

{"prompt":"International aid\n\nThe world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.\nInternational aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.\nDespite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.\nIn conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 431 470\tinternational aid should be prioritised\nT2\tMajorClaim 1593 1722\tpeople from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary\nT3\tClaim 472 501\tInternational aid is critical\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT5\tPremise 580 668\tMany people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards\nT6\tPremise 670 759\tThey lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs\nT7\tPremise 761 974\tWhat is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members\nT8\tPremise 993 1052\tthose people are in desperate need of international support\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nT4\tPremise 1255 1343\tthere is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected\nT9\tPremise 1190 1249\tcharity organisations are mainly funded by the home country\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T4\t\nT10\tPremise 1369 1465\teven within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs\nT11\tPremise 1467 1576\tBy solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth\nT12\tClaim 1123 1177\tit is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens\nA4\tStance T12 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nT13\tPremise 510 578\tpeople from other countries may be facing much more serious problems\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives\n\nNowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.\nFirst, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.\nHowever, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.\nIn conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad.

{"prompt":"Keeping animals in zoos\n\nSince the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.\nFirst, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.\nOn the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.\nIn conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1818 1851\tmore good come from zoos than bad\nT2\tClaim 1754 1796\tboth of the arguments have strong supports\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tClaim 366 403\tkeeping animals in captivity is wrong\nA2\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 412 507\tanimals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 509 615\tThis is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures\nT6\tPremise 634 751\tmany zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tPremise 753 858\tThe animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment\nT8\tPremise 873 967\tsometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 1016 1114\tzoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1116 1294\tMany people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world\nT11\tPremise 1296 1383\tZoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public\nT12\tPremise 1391 1502\tzoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life\nT13\tPremise 1534 1687\tin zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tPremise 1694 1737\tzoos are needed to keep the nature balanced\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\n"}

And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nFirst, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come.

The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.\nThirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves.

{"prompt":"Influence of large factories\n\nNowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.\nFirst of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.\nThe main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.\nHowever, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.\nIn conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 378 508\tthe advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories\nT2\tClaim 524 608\ta large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 610 712\tTo manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit\nT4\tPremise 728 858\tthe factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area\nT5\tPremise 873 960\tthe estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 1002 1168\tIt is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems\nT7\tPremise 1184 1368\tin some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances\nT8\tClaim 962 1000\tThe main disadvantage is contamination\nA2\tStance T8 Against\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT9\tClaim 1484 1587\thow to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1379 1471\tit is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society\nT11\tPremise 1597 1700\tmost problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\n"}

However, I completely disagree with this position.\nTo begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.\nNevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1322 1455\tI disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life\nT2\tPremise 422 478\tthese people will not have an access to a good education\nT3\tPremise 493 531\tthey can be proselytized into bad isms\nT4\tPremise 546 609\tmost of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people\nT5\tPremise 619 702\tthe person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 719 804\tpeople with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms\nT7\tClaim 314 410\tchildren from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery\nA2\tStance T7 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 1033 1059\tthey use it a lot of times\nT9\tClaim 1070 1198\twealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child\nT10\tPremise 1214 1305\tmany good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tClaim 820 945\tpeople who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life\nA3\tStance T11 For\nT12\tClaim 957 1023\tchildren from rich families have better skills on how to use money\nA4\tStance T12 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T12\t\nA5\tStance T9 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Do married women usually work? Why and why not?\n\nPersonally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.\nFirstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.\nSecondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.\nLast but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.\nIn conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 76 212\tmarried women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly\nT2\tClaim 214 305\tWorking outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 635 701\tit is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tMajorClaim 1439 1521\tmarried women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home\nT5\tClaim 1355 1434\ta well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 364 435\textra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses\nT7\tPremise 437 510\tBy taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life\nT8\tPremise 512 629\tThis is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 996 1064\tit is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better\nA4\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 713 862\tworking outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity\nT11\tPremise 864 927\tThese things in turn will make them more confident, independent\nT12\tPremise 929 983\tThese women will set a good example for their children\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nT13\tClaim 1096 1175\tthere are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work\nA5\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1177 1338\tBesides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\n"}

{"prompt":"Advantages and disadvantages of machines instead of human to do the work\n\nThe issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.\nIt is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. \nHowever, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!\nIn conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 1670 1744\twe cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nT2\tMajorClaim 1746 1809\tproblems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well\nT3\tClaim 200 242\talthough using machines have many benefits\nA2\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tMajorClaim 244 281\twe cannot ignore its negative effects\nT5\tPremise 393 555\tNot like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes\nT6\tPremise 570 609\tusing machines can save company's money\nT7\tPremise 619 674\tmachines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension\nT8\tPremise 679 737\temployers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare\nT9\tPremise 739 882\tThe company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nT10\tClaim 304 336\tmachines can bring many benefits\nA3\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tPremise 353 391\tmachines are more effective than human\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 991 1057\tbecause of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job\nT13\tPremise 1059 1162\tEspecially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability\nT14\tPremise 1181 1253\tusing of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT15\tPremise 1268 1369\tnowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing\nT16\tPremise 1375 1516\tthey did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware\nT17\tPremise 1538 1644\tif thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T15\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nT18\tClaim 894 974\tthe disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people\nA4\tStance T18 For\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T18\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T18\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should teenagers learn all school subjects\/focus on one subject\n\nPresently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.\nThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.\nThose who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.\nIt is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2002 2055\tI do support the view of learning all school subjects\nT2\tClaim 1827 1989\tconcentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 475 546\tThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 568 691\twith some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future\nT5\tPremise 693 777\tTeenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate\nT6\tPremise 779 926\tIn students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes\nT7\tPremise 937 1080\tstill many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done\nT8\tPremise 1091 1177\tmost students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tattacks Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 1235 1353\tthis education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness\nA3\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 1380 1476\tstudents can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects\nT11\tPremise 1564 1725\tunder such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nT12\tPremise 1737 1803\tthe dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"People who can’t accept others’ criticism can’t succeed in group working\n\nIn everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.\nFirst, the core of group working is \"consensus\". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his\/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.\nSecond, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: \"The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.\nHowever, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.\nIn conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 310 382\tpeople who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working\nT2\tPremise 871 948\tthe work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member\nT3\tPremise 760 862\tIt doesn't work if one member solely insists on his\/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nT4\tPremise 950 1001\tIt's every member's duty to respect other's opinion\nT5\tClaim 432 472\tthe core of group working is \"consensus\"\nA1\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 474 520\tIt's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts\nT7\tPremise 522 674\tIn group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tPremise 1173 1199\tCriticism definitely hurts\nT9\tPremise 1208 1268\tit points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1279 1367\tcriticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it\nT11\tClaim 1091 1171\tEven if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism\nA2\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1011 1089\ttaking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tPremise 1369 1459\tThose who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT14\tPremise 1477 1606\tif you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works\nT15\tPremise 1608 1668\tAs one Chinese idiom goes: \"The good medicine tastes bitter“\nT16\tPremise 1670 1723\tCriticism might be the most powerful solution to heal\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T11\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T11\t\nT17\tClaim 1966 2015\teven if you are right, criticism is still helpful\nA3\tStance T17 For\nT18\tPremise 2024 2139\tin this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work\nT19\tPremise 2141 2209\tTaking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all\nT20\tPremise 2211 2249\tYou should have your own judgments too\nT21\tPremise 2251 2305\tAnd it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T17\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T17\t\nT22\tMajorClaim 2322 2419\tcriticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism\n"}
