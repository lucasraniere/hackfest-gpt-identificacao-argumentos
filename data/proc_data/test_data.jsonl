{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUse of CCTV cameras\n\nToday, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.\nFirstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.\nFurthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.\nLooking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.\nTo conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nCCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace, with text span (504, 638)\nCCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise, with text span (2404, 2479)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThis is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers, with text span (2481, 2560)\nCCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized, with text span (1229, 1300)\nthese cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers, with text span (1805, 1899)\nThose opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras, with text span (1983, 2096)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nprivacies are lost with the use of these cameras, with text span (2574, 2622)\nsafety should be put first in order to be safe, with text span (2637, 2683)\nby having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down, with text span (649, 728)\nwhen a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced, with text span (746, 877)\nin Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight, with text span (907, 1080)\nas the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops, with text span (1097, 1204)\nthe installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation, with text span (1511, 1588)\nthe customers know very well that their conversations are recorded, with text span (1597, 1663)\nat some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers, with text span (1315, 1400)\nface-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger, with text span (1412, 1502)\none must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences, with text span (2107, 2251)\nopponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime, with text span (2259, 2389)\nthe videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken, with text span (1694, 1793) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternational tourism leads to both - tension and understanding\n\nI agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.\nThere is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. \nOn the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions.

As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.\nTraditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance.

Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.\nSome people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.\nAll in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to, with text span (338, 405)\nprotection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation, with text span (1813, 1936)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nTraditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit, with text span (407, 549)\nprotecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes, with text span (1320, 1411)\nthe government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them, with text span (1617, 1799)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ntechnology takes convenience to humankind, with text span (560, 601)\nit also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle, with text span (603, 679)\ntraditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance, with text span (690, 805)\ntraditional skills rely little on fossil energy, with text span (839, 886)\nit is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change, with text span (888, 988)\nthose tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values, with text span (1002, 1070)\nThese are important foundation of modern civilization, with text span (1072, 1125)\nProtection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems, with text span (1127, 1258)\nthis kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, with text span (1434, 1504)\nthe expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions, with text span (1535, 1605) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology makes people's lives simpler rather than complicated\n\nBelieve it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.\nFirst, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.\nSecond, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.\nAdmittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. \nBased on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe convenience it brings is more, with text span (366, 399)\nthe convenience it brings in people's are significant, with text span (2046, 2099)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ntechnology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, with text span (303, 364)\nwhen it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler, with text span (461, 589)\ntechnology also makes teaching simpler, with text span (856, 894)\ntechnology may make people's life more complicated, with text span (1325, 1375)\ntechnology may make people's life complicated in some cases, with text span (1985, 2044)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWith a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle, with text span (591, 684)\nif you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times, with text span (701, 846)\nIn the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers, with text span (896, 1050)\nWith the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, with text span (1052, 1147)\nall the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once, with text span (1163, 1295)\nthe cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications, with text span (1390, 1559)\nfolks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them, with text span (1575, 1691)\ngames on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones, with text span (1706, 1837)\nmaking their life more complicated and tired, with text span (1853, 1897) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTrue function of a university\n\nUniversities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.\nA university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.\nOn the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.\nIn conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources, with text span (1683, 1778)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nA university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge, with text span (706, 795)\na university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste, with text span (1542, 1666)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nstudents are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, with text span (827, 904)\nHigh school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field, with text span (955, 1207)\nstudents are the ones here to seek knowledge, with text span (909, 953)\nuniversities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather, with text span (1228, 1313)\nIt is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed, with text span (1315, 1488) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo guns can really increase the level of violence?\n\nThe number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.\nOn the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.\nOn the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence, with text span (1570, 1655)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsome military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence, with text span (851, 965)\nthere are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities, with text span (986, 1074)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public, with text span (737, 836)\na police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun, with text span (400, 496)\nAn obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him, with text span (498, 665)\npolice officers can force a criminal to surrender, with text span (678, 727)\nthe number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries, with text span (1085, 1191)\nMany well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably, with text span (1193, 1280)\ncost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs, with text span (1292, 1456)\nMany baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance, with text span (1458, 1533) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFinancial aid to develop countries\n\nAs is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.\nFirstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.\nIn addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.\nIn conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nfinancial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries, with text span (1598, 1656)\nit is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries, with text span (281, 366)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation, with text span (1662, 1839)\nif the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support, with text span (775, 971)\ndeveloping countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries, with text span (1486, 1581)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid, with text span (979, 1121)\neducation is an essential part in development, with text span (492, 537)\nmost developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities, with text span (553, 735)\nsome powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market, with text span (1213, 1358)\nthey rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas, with text span (1368, 1473) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIn personal live, we have some responsibilities towards other people\n\nPeople should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it.

Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live.

People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.\nNobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy, with text span (411, 467)\nthere are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live, with text span (1828, 1988)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nIn personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities, with text span (572, 700)\nprofessional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs, with text span (888, 965)\ndoing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment, with text span (1319, 1389)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nhousework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility, with text span (716, 822)\nI really don't like any of them, however I should do, with text span (824, 876)\nmost people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing, with text span (502, 571)\nI'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field, with text span (1061, 1307)\nNobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone, with text span (967, 1059)\nPeople sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want, with text span (1391, 1502)\none of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like, with text span (1517, 1604)\nAfter insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month, with text span (1606, 1789) END"}

Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. \nFurthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. \nIn conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthere should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses, with text span (238, 364)\nevery student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender, with text span (1592, 1829)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\njudging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular, with text span (470, 607)\nfemale students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females, with text span (931, 1112)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nboth male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education, with text span (619, 758)\nIn India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations, with text span (760, 915)\ndue to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure, with text span (1127, 1356)\nChanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector, with text span (1371, 1536) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould government control media crime\n\nThe soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.\nObviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.\nOn the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.\nWe cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHigh sales reflect power of advertising and not the real need\n\nNowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.\nTo boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.\nHowever, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.\nThe power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIt is essential to have ability to plan and organize\n\nWith the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.\nFirst of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.\nEqually important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.\nFinally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.\nIn this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize, with text span (183, 277)\nthe ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with, with text span (2699, 2801)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions, with text span (284, 350)\ngreat planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive, with text span (410, 506)\nthe capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time, with text span (1030, 1184)\nit is not need for young people to possess this ability, with text span (1987, 2042)\nIn this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, with text span (2616, 2694)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTake myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term, with text span (508, 684)\nYet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control, with text span (686, 897)\nThis plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else, with text span (899, 1009)\nthe employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly, with text span (1202, 1337)\nIf some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent, with text span (1339, 1496)\nthose employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired, with text span (1664, 1833)\nEvery employee can not afford this kind of loss, with text span (1835, 1882)\nthe deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule, with text span (1561, 1648)\nthe ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job, with text span (1910, 1979)\nthis ability is also essential for young people, with text span (2058, 2105)\nyoung people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability, with text span (2112, 2209)\nAs searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs, with text span (2211, 2346)\nthey would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where, with text span (2371, 2432)\nIt is obviously a huge waste of time, with text span (2434, 2470)\nif they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination, with text span (2476, 2614) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo married women usually work? Why and why not?\n\nPersonally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.\nFirstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.\nSecondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.\nLast but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.\nIn conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nmarried women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly, with text span (76, 212)\nmarried women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home, with text span (1439, 1521)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nWorking outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household, with text span (214, 305)\nit is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money, with text span (635, 701)\na well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long, with text span (1355, 1434)\nit is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better, with text span (996, 1064)\nthere are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work, with text span (1096, 1175)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nextra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses, with text span (364, 435)\nBy taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life, with text span (437, 510)\nThis is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present, with text span (512, 629)\nworking outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity, with text span (713, 862)\nThese things in turn will make them more confident, independent, with text span (864, 927)\nThese women will set a good example for their children, with text span (929, 983)\nBesides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women, with text span (1177, 1338) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nNon academic subjects should be removed from syllabus\n\nStudents have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.\nTo begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students' health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people's health, it will also decrease their learning capability.\nIn addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.\nSome people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student's development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nschools should not remove these subjects, with text span (2039, 2079)\nnon-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that, with text span (256, 337)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nnon-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student's development, with text span (1939, 2026)\nRemoving physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people's health, it will also decrease their learning capability, with text span (816, 962)\nschool education should not only focus on the academic development of a student, with text span (1349, 1428)\nstudents can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents, with text span (1541, 1614)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nfrom the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects, with text span (354, 434)\nIf physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students' health, with text span (436, 551)\nafter studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes, with text span (567, 814)\nit is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life, with text span (1432, 1512)\nSuccess in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit, with text span (1145, 1341)\nschools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people, with text span (977, 1055)\nIt is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically, with text span (1057, 1143)\nit is not a good idea, with text span (1640, 1661)\nmost young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents, with text span (1670, 1796)\nparents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills, with text span (1808, 1898) END"}

Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.\nTo begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.\nNevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo modern communication technologies benefit all people\n\nModern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.\nTo begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.\nNevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.\nBy way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication, with text span (428, 550)\nmodern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases, with text span (1794, 1896)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthere are valid arguments to the contrary, with text span (364, 405)\nthese new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind, with text span (1132, 1214)\npeople who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies, with text span (1658, 1755)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nmobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business, with text span (567, 718)\nWith the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds, with text span (720, 841)\nit is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world, with text span (856, 966)\nWith a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine, with text span (968, 1105)\nthe more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits, with text span (1281, 1331)\nthe wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money, with text span (1361, 1472)\nAnyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services, with text span (1474, 1642) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCapital punishment is necessary or not?\n\nCapital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, \"murdering\" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.\nFirst of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.\nSecondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.\nThe third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.\nIn conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\n\"murdering\" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept, with text span (323, 384)\nit is absurd and inhumane, with text span (1700, 1725)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ncapital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, with text span (1605, 1668)\nevery human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life, with text span (422, 514)\ncapital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives, with text span (881, 1069)\nThe third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted, with text span (1290, 1402)\nit can be replaced by a life sentence, with text span (1740, 1777)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhat criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, with text span (525, 624)\nthey are humans and their lives need to be valued, with text span (626, 675)\nexecution does not resolve the consequences of crime, with text span (690, 742)\nit could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled, with text span (759, 869)\nin terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away, with text span (1081, 1288)\nmany people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system, with text span (1463, 1579)\nJuries are also humans, they may lack of discretion, with text span (1404, 1455) END"}

For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. \nOf course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.\nAnother reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.\nWhen you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.\nIn sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nother prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends, with text span (257, 315)\nspending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life, with text span (1873, 1944)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nstaying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences, with text span (384, 498)\na large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded, with text span (1121, 1244)\nWhen you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, with text span (1477, 1614)\nwhile differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement, with text span (773, 897)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\namong a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before, with text span (514, 759)\nif you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages, with text span (1259, 1475)\nthey often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience, with text span (1638, 1733)\nThis would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends, with text span (899, 1011)\nin this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same, with text span (1022, 1096) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nJury must have access to criminals' past records\n\nCourts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.\nMany people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.\nNevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.\nIn conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions, with text span (1454, 1602)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npast behaviour determines the future actions, with text span (358, 402)\nin order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only, with text span (860, 1030)\nI am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict, with text span (1311, 1446)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ncomplete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality, with text span (517, 667)\npast record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder, with text span (682, 844)\na defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record, with text span (1046, 1175)\nInnocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions, with text span (1177, 1294) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nZoos should be banned\n\nChildren tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.\nThere is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.\nAdditionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.\nOn the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.\nIn order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUnder suitable administration, tourism enhances local economic development\n\nTourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.\nThe most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.\nSome people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.\nAfter careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthrough proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas, with text span (400, 547)\nthe tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages, with text span (2168, 2242)\nit is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks, with text span (2259, 2355)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThe most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region, with text span (549, 657)\nSome people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism, with text span (1465, 1562)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThis takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry, with text span (659, 858)\nThe increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs, with text span (860, 1022)\ntourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry, with text span (1037, 1199)\nThis increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes, with text span (1201, 1361)\nthis gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return, with text span (1376, 1463)\ncompared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers, with text span (1573, 1693)\npaper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution, with text span (1709, 1817)\nthe dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated, with text span (1838, 1995)\nIt is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so, with text span (1997, 2107) END"}

Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.\nIn addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.\nAll in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLuck vs hard work\n\nThere are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.\nFirst, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.\nSecondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. \nThirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. \nAlthough it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is one's hard work that helps him reach his target, with text span (244, 297)\nI strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does, with text span (2349, 2443)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nI do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals, with text span (125, 192)\ndepending on luck for everything is not good, with text span (2297, 2341)\nif you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk, with text span (306, 390)\nall my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck, with text span (687, 750)\nthose who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination, with text span (936, 1033)\nif you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target, with text span (1588, 1700)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is good to be lucky, with text span (2273, 2295)\nLuck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way, with text span (392, 478)\nIf it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment, with text span (480, 534)\nI never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals, with text span (756, 817)\nif you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal, with text span (544, 658)\nThey carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal, with text span (1035, 1169)\nIf you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading, with text span (1171, 1244)\na friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery, with text span (1259, 1399)\nHe was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery, with text span (1401, 1486)\nup to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened, with text span (1497, 1576)\nmy boss worked tirelessly for his promotion, with text span (1715, 1758)\nHe looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion, with text span (1760, 1829)\nHe realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors, with text span (1831, 1938)\nhe had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply, with text span (1949, 2065)\nAt the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship, with text span (2067, 2195)\nhe had more credentials than other officers in his capacity, with text span (2202, 2261) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLearning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself.\n\nEvery person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. \nFirstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. \nSecondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhy are groups or organizations important to people?\n\nDuring our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:\nIn the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.\nBy participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.\nFurthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. \nFor the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngroups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds, with text span (2419, 2534)\ngroups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals, with text span (240, 310)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nalmost of us live in the environment of groups, with text span (1087, 1133)\nthe groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults, with text span (464, 554)\nBy participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose, with text span (1135, 1254)\ngroups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal, with text span (1733, 1812)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWe begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life, with text span (556, 717)\nBy making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others, with text span (719, 804)\nAs university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others, with text span (806, 959)\nAfter graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits, with text span (961, 1079)\nA solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons, with text span (1256, 1368)\nas a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year, with text span (1383, 1476)\nWhen being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term, with text span (1478, 1610)\nit is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job, with text span (1623, 1718)\nTzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care, with text span (1876, 2012)\nThey bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit, with text span (2014, 2076)\nFor accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks, with text span (2078, 2202)\nthey could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world, with text span (2275, 2348)\nthey lit the light for the poor and victims, with text span (2217, 2260)\nhumans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups, with text span (366, 449)\nthere are various charities in the world, with text span (1834, 1874) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nParents are the best teachers because they are more special than everybody else\n\nI completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children's lives.\nFirstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him\/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.\nSecondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him\/her than anybody else.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhether it is better to have broad knowledge or not\n\nViews differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.\nFirst of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.\nSecond, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.\nAlthough I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can't success one's own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won't be a problem at all.\nIn conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nhaving a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success, with text span (512, 577)\na broad knowledge of different subjects is really important, with text span (2481, 2540)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nwhen one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier, with text span (631, 716)\nwhen you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields, with text span (1267, 1371)\nif one can't success one's own major, what else things he can do in different filed, with text span (1974, 2057)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nI have studied some of the engineering courses, with text span (1061, 1107)\nWhile some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, with text span (935, 1053)\nIt is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need, with text span (1109, 1257)\nThanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art, with text span (1539, 1635)\nThings ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank, with text span (1637, 1768)\nwhat if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed, with text span (2125, 2194) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHow to learn children more efficiently\n\nEducation is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.\nTo begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. \nSecondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould parents limit their children watching TV to make them do well in school?\n\nIn 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.\nFirst of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.\nMoreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?\nAdmittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. \nIn considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildren should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively, with text span (502, 575)\nIn considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue, with text span (2330, 2477)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nWatching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents, with text span (672, 800)\nthere are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health, with text span (1780, 1877)\nchildren should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation, with text span (2057, 2169)\nchildren are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies, with text span (2487, 2641)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nchildren generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily, with text span (591, 670)\nWhenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours, with text span (847, 963)\nI could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes, with text span (965, 1066)\nI could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook, with text span (1068, 1180)\nI, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying, with text span (1182, 1251)\nChildren are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, with text span (1348, 1420)\nthey are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity, with text span (1432, 1501)\nRecently, more and more children smoke, with text span (1503, 1541)\nthey imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies, with text span (1550, 1596)\naccording to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies, with text span (1617, 1759)\nsometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children, with text span (1263, 1346)\nit doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching, with text span (2224, 2327) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEvery experience always gives us something to learn and keep for life\n\nI agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.\nThe best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.\nAll inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.\nOur difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. \nTherefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLarge amount of violence in television programs\n\nExcessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. \nAdmittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children's television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.\nNevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults' civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. \nIn conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable, with text span (306, 491)\nviolent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency, with text span (1800, 1908)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies, with text span (1059, 1216)\nit would certainly be a violation of adults' civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences, with text span (1232, 1406)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nreducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate, with text span (506, 615)\ngovernments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children's television programs, with text span (676, 774)\nAs a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, with text span (776, 874)\nby watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes, with text span (902, 1046)\nadults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day, with text span (1420, 1500)\nFor whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment, with text span (1502, 1581)\nConsidering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them, with text span (1583, 1761) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTeachers lesson vs other sources\n \nThe way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.\nIt is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.\nOn the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. \nTo put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEconomic development vs environment\n\nCurrently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.\nAdmittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.\nHowever, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.\nFurthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMobile phones: faster communication vs social problems\n\nRecently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.\nIn the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.\nFurthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.\nHowever, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. \nTo sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthis great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society, with text span (272, 348)\nit also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health, with text span (1863, 1962)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmobile phones make our communication faster, with text span (1818, 1861)\nit is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently, with text span (837, 889)\nthe growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development, with text span (904, 976)\nmobile phones have shortened the distance of communication, with text span (1737, 1795)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nas people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills, with text span (475, 722)\ncontinuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture, with text span (734, 822)\nspending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills, with text span (370, 460)\nthere many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature, with text span (992, 1085)\nIn these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors, with text span (1087, 1299)\nfrequent conflicts may occur during communication, with text span (1315, 1364)\nas most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge, with text span (1536, 1729)\nMobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience, with text span (1429, 1514) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSociety should ban all forms of the advertising\n\nIt is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.\nFirst of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.\nOn the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what's the best for us.\nThese days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.\nIn conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nSociety does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers, with text span (475, 635)\nmodern society needs advertising, with text span (1722, 1754)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nAds will keep us well informed about new products and services, with text span (1756, 1818)\nadvertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way, with text span (1857, 1943)\nadvertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited, with text span (678, 769)\nby advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services, with text span (1115, 1207)\nThese days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising, with text span (1307, 1393)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthese kind of ads will have negative effect to our children, with text span (778, 837)\nYoungsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis, with text span (839, 942)\nsome countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries, with text span (957, 1095)\nThanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what's the best for us, with text span (1209, 1305)\ntourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy, with text span (1408, 1466)\nIn order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers, with text span (1468, 1595)\nOnly well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country, with text span (1597, 1692) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhich do you prefer: do only what you already do well, or not.\n\nYou may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.\nFocusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.\nIf you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.\nIn summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nyou should focus on what you are good at, with text span (415, 455)\ndoing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better, with text span (1777, 1869)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nyou will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well, with text span (1073, 1160)\nby doing what you are good at, you will be better at it, with text span (1708, 1763)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be, with text span (530, 629)\nAlbert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity, with text span (645, 819)\nhe hardly cared about something else, with text span (830, 866)\nIt is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup, with text span (868, 958)\nusing two different soups properly was quite annoying, with text span (986, 1039)\nFocusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal, with text span (457, 513)\nWhen you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it, with text span (1236, 1324)\nyou will motivate yourself to do more, with text span (1332, 1369)\nI used to be good at math when I was in junior high school, with text span (1391, 1449)\nI was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, with text span (1459, 1522)\nI became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems, with text span (1524, 1593)\nI could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems, with text span (1608, 1700)\nIf you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it, with text span (1162, 1234) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWill newspapers become a thing of the past?\n\nThe internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.\nFirst of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.\nAnother point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.\nLast, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.\nIn conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nnewspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence, with text span (374, 459)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information, with text span (1090, 1175)\nthe number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time, with text span (1706, 1838)\nnewspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive, with text span (2107, 2188)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nto obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers, with text span (554, 650)\nContrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime, with text span (652, 888)\nAs can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages, with text span (890, 1081)\nfrom the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one, with text span (1200, 1324)\nthe internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries, with text span (1356, 1439)\nThe answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so, with text span (1624, 1687)\nwhen taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down, with text span (1861, 1993)\nThis is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today, with text span (1995, 2090) END"}

Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.\nPeople are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a \"new\" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.\nBesides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.\nAlso, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHigh schools must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum\n\nSome people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.\nTo begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.\nNext, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.\nLast but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.\nIn summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOld and young workers\n\nThroughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.\nFirst and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.\nSecondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.\nLast but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.\nAll in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople should create a sense of co-operation in their children\n\nIt is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:\nCompetitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nNew building construction hold the right to gain more money from government\n\nThe housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.\nBuilding more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.\nOtherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. \nGenerally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nWhat government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction, with text span (268, 424)\nnew building construction hold the right to gain more money from government, with text span (1833, 1908)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nBuilding more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need, with text span (426, 493)\nnew building construction deserves more governmental investment, with text span (1279, 1342)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIf the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class, with text span (583, 712)\nordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government, with text span (720, 920)\nwhen they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency, with text span (930, 1041)\ngovernment should spend money on people to rescue them from this, with text span (1047, 1111)\nonly a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted, with text span (1121, 1241)\nPeople cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in, with text span (495, 581)\nit requires far more resource compare to old building preservation, with text span (1365, 1431)\nBuild a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor, with text span (1433, 1610)\nhundreds of problems would occur during the construction, with text span (1626, 1682)\nonly government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness, with text span (1690, 1788) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDisagree Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed!\n\nIt is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. \nFirst and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. \nSecond, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. \nAdmittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career.

It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. \nIn conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEstablishing a new university in your community\n\nI will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.\nThis new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.\nUndoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. \nHowever, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase.

My arguments are listed as follows. \nFirst, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time.

The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed.

This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.\nNo one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.\nIn addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.\nTo sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures.

There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.\nMany people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.\nThose who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.\nPersonally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nComputers - use, future prospects and over-dependence\n\nComputer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as \"Father of computers\") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.\nIn the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.\nMoreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.\nHowever, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.\nNevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChallenges are different from generation to generation\n\nWhile debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.\nFirst, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. \nSecond, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. \nIn conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nevery prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation, with text span (307, 454)\nchallenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification, with text span (1957, 2090)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters, with text span (2163, 2276)\nunder globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging, with text span (463, 603)\nyoung people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually, with text span (1550, 1646)\nthis generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation, with text span (1297, 1413)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIn the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems, with text span (691, 762)\nevery industry was rather small in size and simple to manage, with text span (771, 831)\nas those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges, with text span (842, 975)\nnow there are more chances to do business with people around the world, with text span (990, 1060)\nbesides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well, with text span (1065, 1132)\nfinancial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, with text span (1155, 1203)\nsurging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management, with text span (1210, 1286)\nThe past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them, with text span (1415, 1535)\nThey are eager for finding who they are and what they really want, with text span (1648, 1713)\nIt is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them, with text span (1715, 1827)\nThey have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences, with text span (1829, 1939) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSporting events easing international tensions, releasing patriotic feelings\n\nFor most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.\nFirstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.\nSecondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.\nIn conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nlarge scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation, with text span (461, 603)\nit is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness, with text span (2175, 2327)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nworld sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace, with text span (1310, 1413)\nit is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events, with text span (1957, 2059)\nThis has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future, with text span (2329, 2417)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nduring times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event, with text span (772, 964)\nwhen Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers, with text span (979, 1137)\ninternational sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality, with text span (1163, 1302)\nthese sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country, with text span (1425, 1512)\nwhen the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field, with text span (1528, 1700)\nSouth African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night, with text span (1702, 1794)\nThis example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team, with text span (1796, 1942) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTesting on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions\n\nPerhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.\nThere are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.\nSecondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.\nThere is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nprimates should have the same rights as human beings, with text span (339, 391)\nit should be made illegal, with text span (1708, 1733)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result, with text span (1631, 1689)\nThere are several reasons why animal testing should be banned, with text span (393, 454)\nsacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity, with text span (1150, 1206)\nhuman beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual, with text span (1506, 1596)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe costs outweigh the benefits, with text span (465, 496)\nEvery year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result, with text span (498, 633)\nAnimal testing costs an enormous amount of money, with text span (635, 683)\nthey must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances, with text span (691, 768)\nanimals are kept in unnatural conditions, with text span (780, 820)\nRecent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs, with text span (822, 935)\nIn March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head, with text span (937, 1121)\nanimals and people's response to a drug can be different, with text span (1422, 1478)\nit is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, with text span (1335, 1414) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDetailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society\n\nNowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.\nIt is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.\nAn even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.\nMost importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.\nIn conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nsuch details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether, with text span (249, 315)\nany descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, with text span (1673, 1737)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\na great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes, with text span (622, 810)\nwithout the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken, with text span (1190, 1324)\nparticular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes, with text span (1344, 1426)\nas they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes, with text span (1739, 1868)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating, with text span (341, 448)\nThese days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings, with text span (450, 606)\nThis may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police, with text span (1014, 1182)\ndetailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise, with text span (850, 1012)\nthey have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced, with text span (1435, 1500)\nWithout their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions, with text span (1502, 1626) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLiving in a higher pace is better\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. \nApart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. \nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI prefer to live in a higher pace condition, with text span (426, 469)\nliving in a higher pace is better, with text span (2031, 2064)\nI prefer to live in high pace, with text span (2165, 2194)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite, with text span (2073, 2147)\nwe have to be eager in our lives, with text span (938, 970)\nkeeping our pace higher is important, with text span (1428, 1464)\nwith a slower pace can enjoy their lives more, with text span (1542, 1587)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwe need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam, with text span (535, 672)\nI just failed to participate in the university entrance exam, with text span (674, 734)\nI thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test, with text span (743, 898)\nkeeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy, with text span (1052, 1115)\nIf I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully, with text span (1117, 1224)\nI had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing, with text span (1240, 1373)\nit is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed, with text span (1596, 1682)\nI do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy, with text span (1769, 1867)\nit is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment, with text span (1882, 1972) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFollow the New Customs of the New Country or Not?\n\nWhen people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.\nOn one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.\nOn the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.\nAll in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country, with text span (386, 450)\nthe immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, with text span (2138, 2197)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs, with text span (465, 558)\nkeeping own customs stably might cause discrimination, with text span (1132, 1185)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWhen people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures, with text span (560, 689)\nThe custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture, with text span (691, 802)\nif one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture, with text span (817, 1027)\npeople understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country, with text span (1042, 1111)\nWhen people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country, with text span (1187, 1326)\nThe local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society, with text span (1328, 1439)\nOne example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969, with text span (1441, 1512)\nThey formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it, with text span (1514, 1579)\nWhile the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working, with text span (1581, 1691)\nbeing much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination, with text span (1702, 1768)\nTheir houses and private cars were buried by local people, with text span (1770, 1827)\nthe locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs, with text span (1837, 1933)\nIf the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated, with text span (1935, 2124) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nClassroom learnng vs online education\n\nThere are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.\nFirst, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.\nSecond, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.\nThird, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.\nIt's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. \nFrom the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nonline classes should never replace classroom learning, with text span (277, 331)\nthe classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons, with text span (2063, 2140)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nclassroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes, with text span (377, 460)\nIt makes you perfect in time management skills, with text span (969, 1015)\nyou learn quickly, with text span (1522, 1539)\nonline classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, with text span (1856, 1930)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIn the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, with text span (462, 525)\nif you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better, with text span (535, 652)\nWhen I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects, with text span (667, 858)\nI got 1st rank in final exam, with text span (868, 896)\nin classroom learning you have to complete study work on time, with text span (906, 967)\nyou can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others, with text span (1026, 1104)\nIt makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career, with text span (1106, 1217)\nprofessors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills, with text span (1226, 1390)\nYou can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts, with text span (1392, 1510)\nFor Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster, with text span (1585, 1833)\nthey could not be substitute of existing classroom learning, with text span (1936, 1995) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nModern cooking methods have improved our life-style significantly\n\nWith technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.\nFirst of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.\nAt the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAdvertising impact on people's choice of consumption\n\nNowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.\nIn addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.\nHowever, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.\nIn my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nbuying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements, with text span (1691, 1771)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npeople will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life, with text span (208, 298)\nit is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need, with text span (1893, 2074)\nA good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society, with text span (756, 886)\nthe advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, with text span (1112, 1169)\nchildren and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, with text span (1425, 1573)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nin most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs, with text span (313, 591)\nfor children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising, with text span (1777, 1888)\nthere are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it, with text span (892, 1045)\nproducts usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought, with text span (606, 754)\nsometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption, with text span (1171, 1233)\nbuying habit is a very personal things for individuals, with text span (1056, 1110)\nIt is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income, with text span (1235, 1334)\nMost of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase, with text span (1336, 1404)\nthey do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary, with text span (1581, 1666) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nNowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past\n\nThe modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.\nTo start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the \"weaker\" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.\nIn the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.\nAdmittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.\nAll things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nThis, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society, with text span (242, 311)\nin a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles, with text span (1755, 1900)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nWomen nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on, with text span (544, 680)\nthe revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well, with text span (925, 1032)\nsuch changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate, with text span (1340, 1422)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe \"weaker\" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields, with text span (698, 902)\nGone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children, with text span (432, 542)\nthe fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society, with text span (350, 430)\nThe financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money, with text span (1034, 1168)\nwomen have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration, with text span (1184, 1326)\nwomen find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives, with text span (1453, 1538)\nchildren might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work, with text span (1546, 1627) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nKeeping animals in zoos\n\nSince the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.\nFirst, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.\nOn the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.\nIn conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nmore good come from zoos than bad, with text span (1818, 1851)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nboth of the arguments have strong supports, with text span (1754, 1796)\nkeeping animals in captivity is wrong, with text span (366, 403)\nzoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology, with text span (1016, 1114)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nanimals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom, with text span (412, 507)\nThis is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures, with text span (509, 615)\nmany zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require, with text span (634, 751)\nThe animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment, with text span (753, 858)\nsometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe, with text span (873, 967)\nMany people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world, with text span (1116, 1294)\nZoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public, with text span (1296, 1383)\nzoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life, with text span (1391, 1502)\nin zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters, with text span (1534, 1687)\nzoos are needed to keep the nature balanced, with text span (1694, 1737) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEmail and text messaging threats written language\n\nThe introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.\nFirst of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.\nThe popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.\nIn conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthey may be factors decreasing the position of written language, with text span (199, 262)\nwe cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity, with text span (1969, 2091)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity, with text span (397, 535)\nThe popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position, with text span (1238, 1345)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nBefore email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones, with text span (537, 665)\nSuch ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information, with text span (667, 808)\nPeople can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want, with text span (876, 952)\nthanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time, with text span (966, 1128)\nThey are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways, with text span (1130, 1236)\nemail and cell phones have improved the obstacles above, with text span (819, 874)\nPeople tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities, with text span (1347, 1476)\nlanguage in writing is not in its original form, with text span (1498, 1545)\npeople compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts, with text span (1567, 1724)\nit is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments, with text span (1736, 1844)\nIf that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand, with text span (1846, 1952) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people\n\nAlthough developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.\nFirst, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.\nSecond, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.\nLastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFarmland, housing and industry or saving land for animals?\n\nNowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.\nFirst, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.\nSecond, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. \nLast I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCapital punishment - necessary or not\n\nCrime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.\nCapital punishment is given only in the \"rarest of the rare\" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.\nMoreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.\nImportantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.\nHowever, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.\nCapital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstrict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society, with text span (252, 316)\nCapital punishment is essential to control violence in the society, with text span (1667, 1733)\npsychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment, with text span (1757, 1869)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nCapital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner, with text span (1871, 1954)\ncapital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals, with text span (589, 652)\nthe rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased, with text span (847, 902)\nCriminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment, with text span (1030, 1162)\nThey can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals, with text span (1270, 1366)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWhen a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment, with text span (452, 581)\nCapital punishment is given only in the \"rarest of the rare\" cases, with text span (318, 384)\nIts first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings, with text span (386, 450)\ncapital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes, with text span (664, 742)\nWhen a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes, with text span (744, 839)\ncapital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals, with text span (917, 1028)\nthe jury giving the verdict are also humans, with text span (1173, 1216)\nThey have the life of a person at their discretion, with text span (1218, 1268)\nThe jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime, with text span (1368, 1450)\nif an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous, with text span (1465, 1548)\nOnly deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment, with text span (1550, 1665) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nParents are our teachers from the very early time in our life\n\nLearning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.\nFirstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.\nSecondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.\nThirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nno one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers, with text span (243, 302)\nparents are our best teachers, with text span (1807, 1836)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nparents are our teachers from the very early time in our life, with text span (391, 452)\nwe will never forget what our parents have taught us, with text span (1087, 1139)\neven when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life, with text span (1382, 1573)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhen we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives, with text span (602, 730)\nAs we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating, with text span (454, 590)\nwe use it every day, with text span (1148, 1167)\nI believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me, with text span (1182, 1288)\nat school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents, with text span (742, 847)\nwe spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school, with text span (864, 933)\nwhen we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, with text span (943, 1062)\nparents love their sons or daughters unconditionally, with text span (1317, 1369)\nmy older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice, with text span (1589, 1768) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail\n\nWhen it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. \nFirstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. \nSecondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. \nAdmittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. \nWhile we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwok in person is preferred, with text span (218, 244)\nI prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email, with text span (2213, 2280)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthis means help to achieve a good communication, with text span (253, 300)\ndiscussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails, with text span (413, 479)\nless misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members, with text span (1547, 1659)\nemails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none, with text span (1770, 1835)\nwork in person will be more efficient, with text span (2289, 2326)\nwe should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience, with text span (1970, 2196)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nteam members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently, with text span (312, 400)\nAn experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity, with text span (481, 594)\nThe first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email, with text span (596, 696)\nthe 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one, with text span (720, 829)\nThe similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other, with text span (831, 974)\nthere will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members, with text span (1079, 1141)\nWriting an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, with text span (1143, 1219)\npeople who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing, with text span (1231, 1324)\ntheir response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim, with text span (1422, 1534)\nif the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed, with text span (1332, 1415)\nwork in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project, with text span (987, 1070)\nsometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place, with text span (1674, 1759)\nit is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas, with text span (1843, 1961) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nRoles of international sports events\n\nWhenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.\nFirst and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.\nSecondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.\nIn conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npopular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely, with text span (252, 358)\ninternational sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely, with text span (2130, 2293)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries, with text span (498, 586)\nsport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations, with text span (752, 892)\nsport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen, with text span (2034, 2113)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nsports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another, with text span (380, 489)\na large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, with text span (596, 666)\nthere are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures, with text span (668, 736)\nAfter sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations, with text span (894, 1105)\nsporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators, with text span (1117, 1220)\nSeeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete, with text span (1222, 1304)\nThe athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country, with text span (1306, 1424)\nWhen witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness, with text span (1426, 1540)\nwhen Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets, with text span (1556, 1677)\nPeople from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President, with text span (1679, 1796)\nThe eager atmosphere lasted many next days, with text span (1798, 1840)\nsome hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally, with text span (1851, 1946)\nthe hooligans only took a minority of people, with text span (1957, 2001) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSuccessful people do something new or take risks\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.\nThe first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.\nMoreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.\nAdmittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nsuccessful people still do things they already know, with text span (493, 544)\ndoing what we already known can still leads us to succeed, with text span (2391, 2448)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite, with text span (2457, 2528)\nsuccessful people do not have to try new things or take risks, with text span (1165, 1226)\nit is not necessary for successful people to take risks, with text span (1836, 1891)\ndoing something new is necessary for people to success, with text span (1973, 2027)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nto be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter, with text span (608, 674)\nThe lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own, with text span (676, 762)\nConsider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment, with text span (764, 865)\nHe can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income, with text span (867, 999)\nHe does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time, with text span (1001, 1122)\nit depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not, with text span (1277, 1352)\na successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success, with text span (1364, 1450)\nthe sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills, with text span (1466, 1562)\nThe same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm, with text span (1564, 1661)\nthose athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed, with text span (1676, 1780)\nthey can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success, with text span (2036, 2123)\nTry something new can indeed make people become special, with text span (2242, 2297)\nwhile it does not mean successful, with text span (2299, 2332) END"}

Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.\nFirst and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.\nApart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.\nAdmittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.\nIn conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old, with text span (299, 365)\nstrongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age, with text span (379, 478)\nit is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement, with text span (2370, 2434)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nmost of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for, with text span (674, 773)\nit would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones, with text span (1803, 1892)\nthe expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated, with text span (1906, 1988)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nif senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates, with text span (550, 659)\na medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available, with text span (803, 1060)\ndue to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace, with text span (1078, 1247)\nnot all elderly workers are physically well, with text span (1266, 1309)\nBeyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses, with text span (1311, 1485)\nthe stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him, with text span (1507, 1594)\nthey will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing, with text span (1610, 1677)\nthe academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution, with text span (1688, 1795)\nTheir invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation, with text span (1990, 2152)\nit is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge, with text span (2161, 2353) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOne important thing that I want to change about my hometown\n\nPublic utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one's needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I'm facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. \nAt first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. \nSecondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.\nLastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.\nTo sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people's living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people's living, with text span (1915, 1999)\nthe thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation, with text span (370, 446)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nI'm facing the traffic congestion every day, with text span (454, 497)\nthis improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly, with text span (1106, 1173)\nit should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train, with text span (546, 646)\nThey should increase more routes to make people transport more easily, with text span (1507, 1576)\nThe necessary energy will slowly be used up, with text span (1821, 1864)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\npeople will have more ways to go to a place, with text span (655, 698)\nnow buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, with text span (706, 774)\nIt makes people in this area have no choice, with text span (776, 819)\nThey must take only a bus to go to another place, with text span (821, 869)\nIf a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them, with text span (871, 954)\npeople can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule, with text span (969, 1046)\nOn the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus, with text span (1048, 1098)\nit is waste of time, with text span (1486, 1505)\nthe buses provide merely two routes in this community, with text span (1186, 1239)\nIt is absolutely a major problem, with text span (1241, 1273)\nif a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus, with text span (1288, 1473)\nhaving more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars, with text span (1586, 1682)\npeople use less their own cars, with text span (1872, 1902)\npeople can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive, with text span (1733, 1819) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology that widen the gap between rich and poor?\n\nTechnology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.\nIn the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.\nSecondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.\nUndoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.\nIn conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOne or two close friends vs. a large number of casual acquaintances\n\nThere is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.\nWe can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.\nSecond, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. \nTo me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances, with text span (207, 303)\nfriends are the most important people in my life second to my family, with text span (1701, 1769)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends, with text span (814, 893)\nclose friends can easily understand each others feelings, with text span (903, 959)\na friend is a person you care about, with text span (1656, 1691)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nbeing a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant, with text span (326, 394)\nit's not easy to make friend with anyone, with text span (403, 443)\nfriends are people who have great compatibility with each other, with text span (455, 518)\nAfter two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways, with text span (520, 707)\nSometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances, with text span (709, 755)\nWe spend time together but we could never be friend, with text span (757, 808)\nacquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends, with text span (1004, 1078)\nthey wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings, with text span (1090, 1145)\nEveryone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time, with text span (1147, 1213)\nBeing friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend, with text span (1215, 1299)\nWhen my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible, with text span (1301, 1436)\nIf my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business, with text span (1438, 1591)\nmy friend will do the same to me, with text span (1607, 1639) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEnvironmental protection vs Economic developments\n\nEnvironmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. \nFirst, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. \nSecond, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.\nSome people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.\nIn conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ntackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments, with text span (365, 460)\nenvironmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence, with text span (2286, 2407)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nenvironmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments, with text span (501, 571)\nthe influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues, with text span (914, 1004)\neconomic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside, with text span (1666, 1739)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwe will all perish as she's gone, with text span (761, 793)\nJust like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well, with text span (795, 903)\nWithout Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain, with text span (657, 752)\nAll the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one, with text span (573, 655)\nEnvironmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems, with text span (1006, 1122)\nTake global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together, with text span (1124, 1255)\nThe melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, with text span (1257, 1463)\nthe rising sea water could drown them, with text span (1471, 1508)\nEnvironmental issues can not be divided by nationality, with text span (1510, 1564)\nall humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth, with text span (1573, 1635)\nif the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away, with text span (1759, 1936)\nthe truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now, with text span (1947, 2084)\nIt would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages, with text span (2086, 2269) END"}
