{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould students be required to attend classes?\n\nThe issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.\nFirstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.\nSecondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.\nIn addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.\nFinally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.\nTo conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudents should be free not to attend classes, with text span (463, 508)\nit is clear that going to classes should be optional for students, with text span (2411, 2476)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills, with text span (517, 627)\nI hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards, with text span (2478, 2640)\nsome students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook, with text span (867, 959)\nbeing free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life, with text span (1232, 1327)\nBy giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves, with text span (2154, 2312)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThis problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic, with text span (961, 1020)\nBy letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching, with text span (1022, 1121)\nthey are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently, with text span (1128, 1217)\nSometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning, with text span (1329, 1461)\nWith a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency, with text span (1463, 1606)\nResearch has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas, with text span (1608, 1734)\nIntrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being, with text span (1940, 2046)\nThese are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time, with text span (2314, 2396)\nin order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims, with text span (2057, 2152) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIt is essential to have ability to plan and organize\n\nWith the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.\nFirst of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.\nEqually important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.\nFinally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.\nIn this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize, with text span (183, 277)\nthe ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with, with text span (2699, 2801)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions, with text span (284, 350)\ngreat planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive, with text span (410, 506)\nthe capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time, with text span (1030, 1184)\nit is not need for young people to possess this ability, with text span (1987, 2042)\nIn this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, with text span (2616, 2694)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nTake myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term, with text span (508, 684)\nYet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control, with text span (686, 897)\nThis plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else, with text span (899, 1009)\nthe employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly, with text span (1202, 1337)\nIf some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent, with text span (1339, 1496)\nthose employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired, with text span (1664, 1833)\nEvery employee can not afford this kind of loss, with text span (1835, 1882)\nthe deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule, with text span (1561, 1648)\nthe ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job, with text span (1910, 1979)\nthis ability is also essential for young people, with text span (2058, 2105)\nyoung people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability, with text span (2112, 2209)\nAs searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs, with text span (2211, 2346)\nthey would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where, with text span (2371, 2432)\nIt is obviously a huge waste of time, with text span (2434, 2470)\nif they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination, with text span (2476, 2614) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy\n\nThe topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.\nFirst and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.\nAnother reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.\nLast but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.\nTo sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power, with text span (347, 414)\nnuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages, with text span (1593, 1699)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons, with text span (532, 611)\neven civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity, with text span (821, 891)\nSafely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it, with text span (1316, 1422)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nLast century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons, with text span (613, 667)\nIf each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage, with text span (669, 774)\nrecently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area, with text span (905, 1061)\nThis unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable, with text span (1063, 1161)\nwhile generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power, with text span (1183, 1314)\nThis waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material, with text span (1424, 1520) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSporting events easing international tensions, releasing patriotic feelings\n\nFor most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.\nFirstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.\nSecondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.\nIn conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nlarge scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation, with text span (461, 603)\nit is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness, with text span (2175, 2327)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nworld sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace, with text span (1310, 1413)\nit is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events, with text span (1957, 2059)\nThis has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future, with text span (2329, 2417)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nduring times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event, with text span (772, 964)\nwhen Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers, with text span (979, 1137)\ninternational sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality, with text span (1163, 1302)\nthese sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country, with text span (1425, 1512)\nwhen the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field, with text span (1528, 1700)\nSouth African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night, with text span (1702, 1794)\nThis example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team, with text span (1796, 1942) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nComputers replace human teachers\n\nWith the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.\nCentral to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.\nOn the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.\nIn short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nat no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced, with text span (1643, 1704)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nInternet can be a useful tool for education, with text span (1598, 1641)\nthe global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate, with text span (378, 534)\ninformation from those sources is subject to question, with text span (1004, 1057)\nit cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can, with text span (1158, 1222)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nInternet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children, with text span (536, 722)\nMuch information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts, with text span (897, 989)\nthe computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong, with text span (1071, 1153)\nThrough face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students, with text span (1224, 1440)\nThis is where the computer proves to be incompetent, with text span (1442, 1493) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGovernment should regard investing in building roads as the most important\n\nThe population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.\nFirst and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.\nSecondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. \nLast but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.\nIn a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable, with text span (1961, 2063)\nthe most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways, with text span (250, 326)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nwe all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents, with text span (381, 479)\ninvesting in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work, with text span (987, 1084)\nspending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality, with text span (1496, 1565)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThe buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia, with text span (481, 606)\nthe sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing, with text span (618, 676)\nthere are many accidents happening on the roads, with text span (696, 743)\nin my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents, with text span (758, 835)\nVietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan, with text span (848, 975)\nNot only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads, with text span (1086, 1162)\nI always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home, with text span (1178, 1270)\nIt is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour, with text span (1272, 1361)\nif the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions, with text span (1376, 1473)\nAll of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes, with text span (1567, 1639)\nThose bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried, with text span (1641, 1732)\nWe should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents, with text span (1734, 1787)\na part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities, with text span (1796, 1851)\nWhat's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier, with text span (1853, 1944) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSmoking should not be permitted in restaurants\n\nGenerally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.\nFirst of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. \nSecondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.\nLast but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.\nIn conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nsmoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants, with text span (421, 498)\nsmoking should not be permitted in restaurants, with text span (1870, 1916)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably, with text span (507, 557)\nSmoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals, with text span (655, 738)\nSmoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children, with text span (1001, 1062)\nSmoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs, with text span (1180, 1299)\nit is unfair for passive smokers, with text span (1745, 1777)\nthere will be a lot of people get disadvantaged, with text span (1925, 1972)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nrestaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals, with text span (573, 653)\nThey will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them, with text span (740, 819)\nrestaurants are places that people usually come with their families, with text span (832, 899)\nthere will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants, with text span (913, 999)\nChildren have a high potential to imitate what adults do, with text span (1064, 1120)\nthey have really high curiosity towards something, with text span (1129, 1178)\nThe most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women, with text span (1301, 1381)\nthey will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies, with text span (1390, 1476)\nthey do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one, with text span (1786, 1853)\npassive smokers will have a lot of health risks, with text span (1498, 1545)\nWhen they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke, with text span (1547, 1620)\nStroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers, with text span (1622, 1722) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nImproving facilities is the best way\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. \nMoreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.\nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInternational tourism leads to both - tension and understanding\n\nI agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.\nThere is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. \nOn the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.\nObviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe Internet is an adequate source of academic information\n\nOver the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.\nFirst and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.\nIn the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.\nCritics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.\nAfter analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning, with text span (536, 608)\nI would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process, with text span (2279, 2354)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils, with text span (630, 751)\nthe Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, with text span (1502, 1569)\nthe Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs, with text span (1851, 1979)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nNowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace, with text span (753, 902)\nthe Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever, with text span (913, 978)\nwith the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance, with text span (990, 1068)\nCollege students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries, with text span (1070, 1220)\nthe Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying, with text span (1242, 1311)\nWhile virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query, with text span (1313, 1480)\nThis fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances, with text span (1748, 1826)\nHave you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously, with text span (1619, 1746)\nthese problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself, with text span (2018, 2126)\nwhat we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study, with text span (2134, 2240) END"}

People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. \nI would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.\nHowever, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.\nIn conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhy are groups or organizations important to people?\n\nDuring our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:\nIn the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.\nBy participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.\nFurthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. \nFor the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngroups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds, with text span (2419, 2534)\ngroups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals, with text span (240, 310)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nalmost of us live in the environment of groups, with text span (1087, 1133)\nthe groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults, with text span (464, 554)\nBy participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose, with text span (1135, 1254)\ngroups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal, with text span (1733, 1812)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nWe begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life, with text span (556, 717)\nBy making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others, with text span (719, 804)\nAs university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others, with text span (806, 959)\nAfter graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits, with text span (961, 1079)\nA solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons, with text span (1256, 1368)\nas a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year, with text span (1383, 1476)\nWhen being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term, with text span (1478, 1610)\nit is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job, with text span (1623, 1718)\nTzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care, with text span (1876, 2012)\nThey bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit, with text span (2014, 2076)\nFor accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks, with text span (2078, 2202)\nthey could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world, with text span (2275, 2348)\nthey lit the light for the poor and victims, with text span (2217, 2260)\nhumans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups, with text span (366, 449)\nthere are various charities in the world, with text span (1834, 1874) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMore convincing\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. \nApart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. \nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI agree that face-to-face communication is better, with text span (469, 518)\nI prefer to express my opinion in person, with text span (2390, 2430)\nthe best way of communication is by means of face-to-face, with text span (2539, 2596)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite, with text span (2439, 2513)\nwe can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way, with text span (1178, 1260)\nwe are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face, with text span (1740, 1817)\ncommunication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication, with text span (1899, 2048)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\ncommunicating in person can be more convincing, with text span (584, 630)\nSometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle, with text span (632, 776)\nHe once complained a service of a restaurant, with text span (778, 822)\nWithout exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it, with text span (824, 957)\nAfterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication, with text span (959, 1038)\nIf he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important, with text span (1040, 1165)\nit is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication, with text span (1346, 1406)\nI had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric, with text span (1422, 1493)\nHe said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore, with text span (1495, 1610)\nI just shocked and did not know what happened, with text span (1612, 1657)\nI realized that his facebook account was stolen, with text span (1668, 1715)\nIt is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words, with text span (2135, 2228)\nTalking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us, with text span (2230, 2346) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIs it necessary to teach children handwriting?\n\nIn this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.\nDespite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.\nSecondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. \nTo conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildren are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting, with text span (264, 330)\nhandwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age, with text span (1658, 1749)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nhandwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning, with text span (404, 462)\npoor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance, with text span (1007, 1082)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthis approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing, with text span (473, 574)\nIt enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well, with text span (576, 679)\nUnder the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting, with text span (681, 772)\nThis way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities, with text span (774, 909)\nkids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons, with text span (1101, 1190)\nIt resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works, with text span (1192, 1276)\nthe increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills, with text span (1288, 1415)\nwith the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes, with text span (1430, 1569) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould high school make music lessons compulsory\n\nMost people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.\nIt is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.\nBy contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.\nIn conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDifferent types of tasks endow more colors to our life\n\nIn my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,\" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all.\" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.\nMost of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to \"happier\", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.\nDoing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.\nDifferent types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSmoking should be made prohibited in public places\n\nPeople the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.\nTo start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain.

Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould universities accept equal number of males\/females or not\n\nEducation is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.\nRight to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.\nCo-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.\nUnfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.\nThus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nUniversities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices, with text span (324, 397)\nboth genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers, with text span (1686, 1769)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nEquality in education will help in development of the society, with text span (1771, 1832)\nfemales should be given equal opportunities as males, with text span (534, 586)\nUniversities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run, with text span (1134, 1257)\nsome male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc, with text span (1274, 1396)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nBoth genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior, with text span (1834, 1918)\nThe whole world aims for women empowerment, with text span (469, 511)\nRight to education is a basic human right of both, males and females, with text span (399, 467)\nWhen universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop, with text span (588, 740)\nCo-education helps both genders to gel well with each other, with text span (742, 801)\nIt helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together, with text span (803, 862)\nstudents studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them, with text span (877, 985)\nfemales studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys, with text span (1006, 1066)\nCo-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both, with text span (1068, 1132)\nThis kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society, with text span (1398, 1483)\nwomen have proved their mettle in every field, with text span (1501, 1546)\nWomen like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills, with text span (1548, 1656) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail\n\nWhen it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. \nFirstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. \nSecondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. \nAdmittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. \nWhile we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nwok in person is preferred, with text span (218, 244)\nI prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email, with text span (2213, 2280)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthis means help to achieve a good communication, with text span (253, 300)\ndiscussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails, with text span (413, 479)\nless misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members, with text span (1547, 1659)\nemails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none, with text span (1770, 1835)\nwork in person will be more efficient, with text span (2289, 2326)\nwe should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience, with text span (1970, 2196)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nteam members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently, with text span (312, 400)\nAn experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity, with text span (481, 594)\nThe first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email, with text span (596, 696)\nthe 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one, with text span (720, 829)\nThe similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other, with text span (831, 974)\nthere will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members, with text span (1079, 1141)\nWriting an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, with text span (1143, 1219)\npeople who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing, with text span (1231, 1324)\ntheir response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim, with text span (1422, 1534)\nif the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed, with text span (1332, 1415)\nwork in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project, with text span (987, 1070)\nsometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place, with text span (1674, 1759)\nit is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas, with text span (1843, 1961) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudy at school or get a job?\n\nMany people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.\nFirst of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.\nNevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.\nOverall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nstudent have to be forced to study at school, with text span (337, 381)\nstudents should study at school, with text span (1541, 1572)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthere are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, with text span (1586, 1643)\nthey have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future, with text span (837, 914)\nchildren should interrupt their school work and get a job, with text span (1094, 1151)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nstudying at school is always the best choice for children's future, with text span (1645, 1711)\nThere are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job, with text span (1713, 1820)\nemployer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills, with text span (941, 1027)\nschools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying, with text span (397, 508)\nschools provide lots of academic knowledge to students, with text span (680, 734)\nStudents may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences, with text span (736, 824)\nIt creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things, with text span (510, 663)\nWhether children can learn a lot at school, with text span (1153, 1195)\nthere are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future, with text span (1197, 1271)\nchildren can learn social skills when they have a job, with text span (1286, 1339)\nThey can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school, with text span (1341, 1405)\nWorking helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned, with text span (1407, 1515) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWill newspapers become a thing of the past?\n\nThe internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.\nFirst of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.\nAnother point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.\nLast, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.\nIn conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nnewspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence, with text span (374, 459)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information, with text span (1090, 1175)\nthe number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time, with text span (1706, 1838)\nnewspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive, with text span (2107, 2188)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nto obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers, with text span (554, 650)\nContrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime, with text span (652, 888)\nAs can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages, with text span (890, 1081)\nfrom the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one, with text span (1200, 1324)\nthe internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries, with text span (1356, 1439)\nThe answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so, with text span (1624, 1687)\nwhen taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down, with text span (1861, 1993)\nThis is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today, with text span (1995, 2090) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWhether athletes and singers are overpaid?\n\nSome people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.\nFirst of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. \nHowever, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.\nFrom all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ntheir salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields, with text span (276, 400)\nprofessional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions, with text span (2040, 2118)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nathletes and singers deserve their current salary, with text span (439, 488)\ntheir privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities, with text span (1859, 2003)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey have an exceptional ability that other people do not own, with text span (497, 558)\nhardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship, with text span (573, 723)\nThey also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves, with text span (725, 906)\nthere are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately, with text span (930, 1020)\nOvercoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts, with text span (1022, 1127)\nsingers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society, with text span (1200, 1291)\nIt is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms, with text span (1293, 1412)\nWhile scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life, with text span (1414, 1669)\nThey commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience, with text span (1671, 1748)\ntheir contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary, with text span (1758, 1850) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nRush vs Slower Pace\n\nModern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.\nFirst, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.\nIn addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.\nFinally, quality takes time.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe option to work or study from home is advantage or disadvantage\n\nUndoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.\nOn the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.\nOn the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.\nFollowing both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks, with text span (1630, 1724)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious, with text span (998, 1076)\nThese factors affect people who work or study from home, with text span (1538, 1593)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit helps working people to maintain work life balance, with text span (560, 613)\nthe new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby, with text span (635, 704)\nPeople also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours, with text span (706, 771)\nFor students too, studying from home is an attractive option, with text span (773, 833)\nThey save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies, with text span (835, 919)\nIn a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling, with text span (921, 990)\nthe benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous, with text span (467, 549)\nonce an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues, with text span (1230, 1351)\nThis harms an employee's deliverable, with text span (1353, 1389)\nTeachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly, with text span (1391, 1497) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould wealthy nations support poor ones?\n\nWhether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.\nIn terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.\nEconomically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.\nIn summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nas the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor, with text span (247, 345)\nwealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways, with text span (1486, 1612)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nOnly those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run, with text span (1614, 1688)\nit is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so, with text span (367, 528)\nsuch aid could also create a win-win situation, with text span (691, 737)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nCompassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals, with text span (530, 666)\nUnderdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds, with text span (739, 813)\nFor developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations, with text span (815, 918)\nrelated research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry, with text span (925, 1047)\nThe potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning, with text span (1049, 1164)\nBy building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce, with text span (1166, 1316)\nThe underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy, with text span (1318, 1472) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTaking a break before starting higher education is a good idea\n\nNowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.\nExperience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.\nTaking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.\nIn my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education, with text span (1557, 1629)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nStudents who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working, with text span (1631, 1721)\nExperience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way, with text span (375, 486)\nTaking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts, with text span (864, 945)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nThey tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature, with text span (1723, 1816)\nIt not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent, with text span (488, 568)\nStudent's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies, with text span (570, 686)\nThis experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life, with text span (688, 771)\nThey develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses, with text span (773, 862)\nThey might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment, with text span (1072, 1139)\nThere is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education, with text span (1141, 1223)\nProbably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries, with text span (1225, 1380)\nThis might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification, with text span (1382, 1537)\nOnce student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence, with text span (947, 1070) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nProfessors should do more research or teach students?\n\nThese days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.\nFirst of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.\nSecondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. \nLast but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. \nFor those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nprofessors should be encouraged to mainly do research, with text span (299, 352)\nit is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research, with text span (2030, 2106)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nWhile extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society, with text span (2108, 2224)\nThe research projects like windows opened to the wider world, with text span (905, 965)\nprofessors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities, with text span (977, 1063)\ndoing research could also improve the teaching quality, with text span (1503, 1557)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nby doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies, with text span (554, 649)\nThe research projects provide communication with the outside, with text span (479, 539)\ndoing research is a method of self-improvement for professors, with text span (368, 429)\nUniversities are relatively fenced environment, with text span (431, 477)\nI still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college, with text span (651, 748)\nHe was often invited to do speech in other universities, with text span (750, 805)\nmy university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects, with text span (816, 903)\nyou could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together, with text span (1141, 1219)\nthere is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages, with text span (1235, 1313)\nIt is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus, with text span (1065, 1133)\nWe all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin, with text span (1315, 1420)\nUniversities positively contribute the professors' success, with text span (1422, 1480)\nWith the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom, with text span (1559, 1675)\nThey can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice, with text span (1677, 1746)\nI still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project, with text span (1748, 1845)\nBy participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments, with text span (1847, 1944)\nThe research project provides a more efficient way of teaching, with text span (1946, 2008) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCheap air travel should be encouraged?\n\nIn recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.\nIt is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.\nOn the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. \nIn conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nArtists' freedom to express ideas\n\nArtists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.\nFirst and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.\nFurthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.\nLooking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.\nTo conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece, with text span (301, 394)\nthere should not be any restrictions on artists' work, with text span (2217, 2270)\nthere should be no restrictions on them, with text span (2624, 2663)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthere are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas, with text span (2515, 2594)\nwithout any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists, with text span (844, 923)\nhuman rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely, with text span (1486, 1570)\nIn case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society, with text span (1865, 2019)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nAllowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves, with text span (2272, 2353)\nideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations, with text span (2357, 2411)\neven though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, with text span (2420, 2488)\nif there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run, with text span (416, 524)\nwhen they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies, with text span (548, 707)\npaintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times, with text span (722, 832)\nit is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation, with text span (938, 1070)\nToday, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries, with text span (1072, 1158)\nArts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country, with text span (1160, 1277)\nthe famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn, with text span (1307, 1478)\nartists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts, with text span (2049, 2179)\nThey might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country, with text span (1665, 1748)\nMalaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace, with text span (1770, 1863) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCapital punishment is necessary or not?\n\nCapital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, \"murdering\" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.\nFirst of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.\nSecondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.\nThe third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.\nIn conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\n\"murdering\" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept, with text span (323, 384)\nit is absurd and inhumane, with text span (1700, 1725)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\ncapital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, with text span (1605, 1668)\nevery human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life, with text span (422, 514)\ncapital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives, with text span (881, 1069)\nThe third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted, with text span (1290, 1402)\nit can be replaced by a life sentence, with text span (1740, 1777)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwhat criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, with text span (525, 624)\nthey are humans and their lives need to be valued, with text span (626, 675)\nexecution does not resolve the consequences of crime, with text span (690, 742)\nit could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled, with text span (759, 869)\nin terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away, with text span (1081, 1288)\nmany people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system, with text span (1463, 1579)\nJuries are also humans, they may lack of discretion, with text span (1404, 1455) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCompetition or co-operation-which is better\n\nThe modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.\nCo-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.\nNevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.\nUnfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.\nHowever, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.\nThus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTraditional games or modern games in developing children's skills\n\nGames have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.\nIt is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.\nHowever, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.\nFurthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.\nThus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nparents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games, with text span (414, 486)\ntraditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games, with text span (2167, 2272)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nOnly through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process, with text span (2274, 2375)\nmodern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend, with text span (504, 660)\ntraditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society, with text span (1038, 1184)\nit is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today, with text span (1602, 1683)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nchildren have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future, with text span (678, 860)\nchildren have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative, with text span (880, 1019)\nOne primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills, with text span (1186, 1276)\nUnlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face, with text span (1278, 1485)\ncommunicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more, with text span (1500, 1587)\nthese traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices, with text span (1694, 1869)\nmodern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits, with text span (1884, 1955)\nthere is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival, with text span (1968, 2137) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould teenagers learn all school subjects\/focus on one subject\n\nPresently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.\nThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.\nThose who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.\nIt is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nI do support the view of learning all school subjects, with text span (2002, 2055)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nconcentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future, with text span (1827, 1989)\nThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized, with text span (475, 546)\nthis education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness, with text span (1235, 1353)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwith some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future, with text span (568, 691)\nTeenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate, with text span (693, 777)\nIn students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes, with text span (779, 926)\nstill many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done, with text span (937, 1080)\nmost students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs, with text span (1091, 1177)\nstudents can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects, with text span (1380, 1476)\nunder such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study, with text span (1564, 1725)\nthe dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study, with text span (1737, 1803) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOur useful friends\n\nPets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.\nFirst, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.\nSecondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. \nTo sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npets should be treated like human beings, with text span (354, 394)\npets deserve to be treated like family members, with text span (1724, 1770)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npets are our friends as well as certain human beings are, with text span (425, 481)\npets are useful for a variety of things, with text span (1136, 1175)\nthey are our friends and they can be useful in many situations, with text span (1822, 1884)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey listen to us, more than some people will ever do, with text span (602, 655)\nWe can talk to them, with text span (574, 593)\nWhen I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important, with text span (720, 816)\nTalking to my friends was frustrating, with text span (818, 855)\nnone of them have ever felt that way, with text span (864, 900)\nI was all alone at home for a long time, with text span (908, 947)\nmy dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings, with text span (949, 1037)\npets aren't able to speak with us, with text span (1057, 1090)\nwe can nonetheless count on them, with text span (1092, 1124)\nSimilarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone, with text span (483, 572)\nnowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before, with text span (1190, 1251)\nResearchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses, with text span (1253, 1339)\nThere are dogs who lead blind people around the city, with text span (1341, 1393)\npets are important for depressed people as well, with text span (1470, 1517)\nwithout them they could not go around all alone, with text span (1408, 1455)\ntheir presence make them feel better, with text span (1526, 1562)\nthere are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs, with text span (1574, 1681) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe gender issue for getting education needs\n\nThe gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.\nThe proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.\nAnother reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.\nIn conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender.

Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.\nFirst, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.\nMoreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.\nFinally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.\nIn conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nRicher nations should help poorer nations in health, education and trade\n\nImprovements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.\nFirstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.\nSecondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.\nLastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.\nIn conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome people believe that there should be fixed punishment for each crime type\n\nGenerally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.\nFirst of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance \"a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction\". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.\nOn the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.\nTo conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis.

For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. \nHowever, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability.

I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.\nPrimarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.\nSecondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. \nBesides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.\nTo sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious, with text span (2388, 2441)\nit might not be the most beneficial move to our society, with text span (431, 486)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nrough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive, with text span (2448, 2506)\nwe need to catch up with the pace of the world, with text span (2340, 2386)\nfast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world, with text span (357, 420)\neven when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy, with text span (499, 568)\nEven when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients, with text span (1346, 1542)\nSome work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, with text span (1867, 1912)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nEven simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy, with text span (570, 637)\nIf we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline, with text span (639, 820)\nit only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless, with text span (832, 890)\nIt is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it, with text span (892, 991)\nit may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, with text span (1003, 1090)\nwith consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work, with text span (1096, 1186)\nWe soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace, with text span (1544, 1613)\nwhen the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made, with text span (1620, 1707)\nThis might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start, with text span (1709, 1802)\nother than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality, with text span (1198, 1344)\nA miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars, with text span (2013, 2144)\neven when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems, with text span (2169, 2317)\nin official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic, with text span (1928, 2011) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nProblems and benefits of international tourism\n\nAlong with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.\nI admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.\nHowever, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.\nFurthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.\nIn conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale, with text span (1891, 1966)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthere are some inevitable problems, with text span (1977, 2011)\ntourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment, with text span (277, 338)\nflourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy, with text span (867, 945)\nthe increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well, with text span (1395, 1463)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken, with text span (2013, 2094)\nIn order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats, with text span (340, 537)\nTourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels, with text span (539, 723)\ntourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged, with text span (763, 856)\nHoliday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment, with text span (947, 1115)\nBoth local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well, with text span (1117, 1264)\nthe revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment, with text span (1281, 1380)\nThe provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably, with text span (1465, 1563)\nWith adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing, with text span (1565, 1681)\nboth locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations, with text span (1696, 1874) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nKeep trying and never stop working for your goals\n\n\"Keep running!,\" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. \nFirstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. \nSecondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. \nThirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on.

He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. \nFor these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildren engagement in paid work\n\nIn many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.\nFirst of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.\nSecondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.\nSome people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.\nIn conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks, with text span (345, 416)\nif children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible, with text span (1581, 1724)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving, with text span (730, 846)\nwhen children take jobs, they tend to be more responsibl, with text span (858, 914)\nchildren will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers, with text span (1296, 1398)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nchildren can learn about the hardship of earning money, with text span (432, 486)\nWhen they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life, with text span (488, 717)\nwhether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working, with text span (924, 1018)\nTo keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties, with text span (1020, 1099)\nif a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost, with text span (1114, 1267)\nif children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way, with text span (1409, 1564) END"}

I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.\nWhen pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other.

In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. \nIncreasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nHigh sum of money of modern artist\n\nThe amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.\nProficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible.

He granted huge sums for such idea.\nStriking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing \"I swear\" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.\nHaving said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSaving\/Spending money\n\nIn recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.\nFirst, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.\nIn addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. \nFinally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.\nConsidering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nsaving some part of your earnings is essential, with text span (300, 346)\nthere is no other choice than saving money for some time, with text span (1863, 1919)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nyou can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams, with text span (368, 522)\nThe global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account, with text span (595, 753)\nIt is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings, with text span (1082, 1192)\nWorking hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished, with text span (1462, 1622)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence, with text span (925, 1002)\nThey could not afford the rent, with text span (890, 920)\nI remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe, with text span (766, 855)\nthere are several uncertainties about your professional future, with text span (531, 593)\nyou can not be sure about the development in your personal life, with text span (1017, 1080)\nBack in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car, with text span (1194, 1318)\nHe could not afford the maintenance, with text span (1320, 1355)\nhe had to sell it, with text span (1359, 1376)\nwith savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams, with text span (1388, 1460)\nI made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend, with text span (1638, 1725)\nWithout our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream, with text span (1727, 1792) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nApartments vs dormitories at university\n\nMany students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.\nFirst, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.\nSecond, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.\nLastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould professors doing more research or educating students more?\n\nAlthough professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.\nA professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him\/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.\nAs for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.\nFinally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.\nIn conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPaying taxes is enough contribution from citizens\n\nPaying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.\nTo start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.\nHowever, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.\nIn conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthey have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way, with text span (1843, 1944)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nall people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, with text span (271, 335)\ncitizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax, with text span (878, 956)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nit is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens, with text span (340, 439)\na large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, with text span (454, 548)\nevery one can work and live in a peaceful environment, with text span (558, 611)\nThe tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers, with text span (613, 736)\nthese workers do not produce profit directly, with text span (747, 791)\nwhat they do is for the well-being of the whole society, with text span (793, 848)\nthere are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others, with text span (970, 1066)\nthe government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, with text span (1084, 1147)\nsuch financial help is usually far from enough, with text span (1153, 1199)\naids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support, with text span (1215, 1336)\nAnother responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force, with text span (1338, 1448)\nThere are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited, with text span (1450, 1550)\nit is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department, with text span (1555, 1736) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification\n\nThe career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.\nA full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.\nMoreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named \"Technological Unemployment\". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\npeople are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves, with text span (1716, 1890)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\npeople are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition, with text span (781, 890)\nThe best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs, with text span (1467, 1529)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nwith the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall, with text span (580, 691)\nThis overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers, with text span (693, 766)\nA full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family, with text span (468, 574)\ncorporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors, with text span (1551, 1666)\nmany people's jobs are now at high stake, with text span (1425, 1465)\nrobots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies, with text span (1239, 1418)\nNorth American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one, with text span (1058, 1224)\nthe arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment, with text span (902, 993) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould replace normal classroom with online computer classes?\n\nThere are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.\nSecondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.\nLastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. \nIn conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nClassroom learnng vs online education\n\nThere are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.\nFirst, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.\nSecond, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.\nThird, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.\nIt's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. \nFrom the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nonline classes should never replace classroom learning, with text span (277, 331)\nthe classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons, with text span (2063, 2140)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nclassroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes, with text span (377, 460)\nIt makes you perfect in time management skills, with text span (969, 1015)\nyou learn quickly, with text span (1522, 1539)\nonline classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, with text span (1856, 1930)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nIn the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, with text span (462, 525)\nif you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better, with text span (535, 652)\nWhen I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects, with text span (667, 858)\nI got 1st rank in final exam, with text span (868, 896)\nin classroom learning you have to complete study work on time, with text span (906, 967)\nyou can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others, with text span (1026, 1104)\nIt makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career, with text span (1106, 1217)\nprofessors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills, with text span (1226, 1390)\nYou can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts, with text span (1392, 1510)\nFor Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster, with text span (1585, 1833)\nthey could not be substitute of existing classroom learning, with text span (1936, 1995) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues\n\nIn today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.\nThe second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.\nIn conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions, with text span (274, 387)\na greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being, with text span (1619, 1812)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsociety should be educated and became aware of health issues, with text span (736, 796)\na government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives, with text span (1233, 1388)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients, with text span (805, 944)\ndecreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients, with text span (541, 723)\nthere is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health, with text span (1112, 1220)\nthe marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign, with text span (1403, 1602) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildren should studying hard or playing sport? Both can improve their future\n\nSome people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. \nOn the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.\nAt the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould teachers be paid according to how much their students learn?\n\nEveryone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.\nTo begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.\nSecond, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.\nLastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.\nIn conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould we require our young children to learn music and art\n\nEvery parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. \nFirst, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.\nSecond, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.\nHowever, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. \nIn conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his\/her life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildren should learn music and art in a young age, with text span (371, 421)\nyoung age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art, with text span (2048, 2113)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey do contribute several merits to them, with text span (430, 471)\nMusic and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his\/her life, with text span (2204, 2299)\nit's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young, with text span (481, 567)\neven if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy, with text span (1322, 1425)\nparents shouldn't put so much stress on children, with text span (1523, 1571)\nthey are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage, with text span (2118, 2202)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthey are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances, with text span (875, 977)\nChildren are privileged to have these abilities, with text span (819, 866)\nChildren absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination, with text span (569, 667)\nMusic and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules, with text span (669, 740)\nThey are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched, with text span (742, 817)\nEven if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination, with text span (979, 1119)\nmusic and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing, with text span (1129, 1188)\nThey teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way, with text span (1190, 1267)\nThey are essential to our spiritual life, with text span (1269, 1309)\nit can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure, with text span (1434, 1483)\nlearning too many skills seems to be a burden for them, with text span (1579, 1633)\nit depends on how you value these learning activities to be like, with text span (1650, 1714)\nIf parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much, with text span (1716, 1842)\nIn a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills, with text span (1844, 1975)\nit will not be such pressure on children, with text span (1990, 2030) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAdvanced fertilizers and machine for farmers, good or bad?\n\nIn recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.\nAdmittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.\nHowever, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.\nMoreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.\nIn conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked, with text span (1881, 1977)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nnewly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, with text span (1765, 1857)\nthe production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased, with text span (756, 854)\nhigh-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being, with text span (865, 944)\nexcessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society, with text span (1299, 1396)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\napplying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit, with text span (437, 552)\nartificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest, with text span (570, 740)\nUnlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently, with text span (946, 1158)\nconsumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future, with text span (1174, 1287)\nOne is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission, with text span (1398, 1482)\nmanual harvest prevents severe environmental damages, with text span (1497, 1549)\nmechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, with text span (1564, 1646)\nhigh-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields, with text span (1665, 1736) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nAre museums necessary?\n\nI believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.\nMost people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.\nIn order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you \"visit\" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.\nSeeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEconomic development vs environment\n\nCurrently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.\nAdmittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.\nHowever, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.\nFurthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.\nTherefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nflourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation, with text span (313, 386)\nthriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously, with text span (2065, 2149)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthe economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting, with text span (964, 1036)\nthe booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment, with text span (1057, 1137)\ntaking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies, with text span (1511, 1587)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nunchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources, with text span (834, 948)\npeople in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems, with text span (711, 819)\nsome countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments, with text span (400, 517)\nthey have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards, with text span (627, 700)\nthese needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, with text span (522, 625)\nWith people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales, with text span (1139, 1375)\nelectronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years, with text span (1390, 1496)\nit may spur its economic development, with text span (1766, 1802)\nIf a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity, with text span (1589, 1753)\nwithout the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development, with text span (1823, 2030) END"}

When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.\nThere is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff.

There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.\nThere are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can't be always found in books. \nI do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits\n\nAdvertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.\nFirst of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. \nSecond, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. \nIn conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nA greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues\n\nIn today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.\nThe second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.\nIn conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\na greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being, with text span (1619, 1812)\ngovernments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions, with text span (274, 387)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nsociety should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients, with text span (736, 944)\ngovernments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society, with text span (968, 1095)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\neducation and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system, with text span (410, 524)\ndecreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients, with text span (541, 723)\nthere is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health, with text span (1112, 1220)\na government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives, with text span (1233, 1388)\nthe marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign, with text span (1403, 1602) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTrue function of a university\n\nUniversities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.\nA university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.\nOn the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.\nIn conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nthe main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources, with text span (1683, 1778)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nA university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge, with text span (706, 795)\na university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste, with text span (1542, 1666)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nstudents are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, with text span (827, 904)\nHigh school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field, with text span (955, 1207)\nstudents are the ones here to seek knowledge, with text span (909, 953)\nuniversities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather, with text span (1228, 1313)\nIt is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed, with text span (1315, 1488) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas?\n\nWhen we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don't think it's proper.\nFirst, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don't want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can't always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.\nEven in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.\nIn fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won't last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nI believe it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community\n\nI believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.\nIn the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.\nFurthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.\nLastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.\nFor the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nit is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community, with text span (94, 161)\nI advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community, with text span (1775, 1878)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\na large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time, with text span (779, 870)\nit not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs, with text span (885, 948)\nit is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand, with text span (1259, 1371)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping, with text span (213, 323)\nQueens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose, with text span (353, 562)\nit is one of the most productive malls in New York, with text span (590, 640)\nI could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there, with text span (655, 751)\nThere may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall, with text span (950, 1053)\nIt could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job, with text span (1055, 1147)\nSome students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money, with text span (1149, 1249)\nThere may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers, with text span (1373, 1482)\nwith sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy, with text span (1497, 1604)\nthe residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes, with text span (1619, 1740) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould governments spend more money on improving roads and highways\n\nNowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.\nFirst and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. \nIn addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.\nIn conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment, with text span (328, 397)\npublic transportation systems even have more important advantages, with text span (1968, 2033)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nthey help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air, with text span (484, 578)\nthe policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth, with text span (1244, 1353)\nThis is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment, with text span (947, 1075)\ngovernments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes, with text span (1641, 1732)\nhigh-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around, with text span (1891, 1952)\nThey not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere, with text span (2035, 2097)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nSuch public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society, with text span (399, 473)\nif there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released, with text span (1086, 1231)\ncarbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere, with text span (637, 713)\nthe more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged, with text span (732, 820)\nIf governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work, with text span (822, 945)\nthere are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads, with text span (1554, 1607)\nIt is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities, with text span (1432, 1513)\nThere is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion, with text span (1734, 1853)\nthe policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam, with text span (1369, 1430) END"}

Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. \nMoreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFunding artists\n\nNowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.\nThe main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.\nIn addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.\nAnother reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.\nTo sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\ngovernments should help and encourage artists to continue their work, with text span (1747, 1815)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nart is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, with text span (1627, 1734)\nthe governments should help arts, with text span (855, 887)\nculture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art, with text span (1114, 1181)\ntalent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted, with text span (1363, 1423)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nart helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists, with text span (517, 593)\nmonuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists, with text span (608, 772)\nsome countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, with text span (783, 847)\ntheir work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry, with text span (896, 962)\nsculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation, with text span (977, 1101)\nYoung people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts, with text span (1183, 1306)\nnot many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts, with text span (1433, 1503)\nthis type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature, with text span (1512, 1614) END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEasy preparation of food leads to a better life\n\nThe Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people's lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.\nFirstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don't have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.\nSecondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he\/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nI'm against providing more money to professors\n\nUniversity education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. \nTo begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.\nBesides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. \nAt school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nMoney should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors, with text span (358, 481)\nI against providing more money to professors, with text span (2365, 2409)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nThe professors are essential, with text span (277, 305)\nthe school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors, with text span (530, 599)\nTo improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate, with text span (1526, 1612)\nStudents' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university, with text span (2239, 2340)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nthe schools are established for students, with text span (316, 356)\nthe most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively, with text span (609, 699)\nBy renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment, with text span (701, 798)\nA comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer, with text span (800, 859)\nstudents spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning, with text span (867, 940)\nstudents have a better environment to working on their assignments, with text span (958, 1024)\nthe quality of their assignments will improve, with text span (1028, 1073)\nthe competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation, with text span (1081, 1143)\nIn my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby, with text span (1145, 1217)\nI prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment, with text span (1227, 1312)\nIt's unpleasant to stay at school, with text span (1314, 1347)\ncoffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly, with text span (1358, 1445)\nthe ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better, with text span (1456, 1524)\nHigh-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money, with text span (1777, 1857)\nThere won't be any effect if school does so, with text span (1859, 1902)\nThere was news about raising professors' salary in my country, with text span (1904, 1965)\nThis event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly, with text span (1967, 2031)\nThe proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries, with text span (2033, 2103)\nif the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen, with text span (2121, 2202) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildren managing their own money - best way to learn responsibility\n\nOne of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.\nThe first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.\nAnother aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.\nAlthough some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The essay main claims are:\n\nchildren should learn to manage their own money at a young age, with text span (374, 436)\nit is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, with text span (2220, 2335)\n\nThe essay claims are:\n\nit is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues, with text span (647, 730)\nEven in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity, with text span (1352, 1545)\nchildren should be free to spend money to they what they want, with text span (2143, 2204)\nour personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood, with text span (2345, 2423)\n\nThe essay premises are:\n\nsociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne, with text span (528, 642)\nwhen I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked, with text span (800, 877)\nFirst time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished, with text span (879, 952)\nI asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me, with text span (954, 1019)\nI found that I should manage the way that I spend money, with text span (1021, 1076)\nI learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted, with text span (1088, 1150)\nI had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood, with text span (1567, 1680)\nHe became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money, with text span (1682, 1769)\nHis parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless, with text span (1771, 1901)\nFinally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died, with text span (1903, 2011)\nNot only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family, with text span (2013, 2109)\nIf parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs, with text span (1243, 1350) END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould the Government Provide Free College?\n\nSome people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. \nFirst, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. \nSecond, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.\nThird, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research.
