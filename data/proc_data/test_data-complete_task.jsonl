{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFarmland, housing and industry or saving land for animals?\n\nNowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.\nFirst, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.\nSecond, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. \nLast I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.\nAll in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 398 463\thuman needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important\nT2\tClaim 2121 2163\tprotecting endangered animals is necessary\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tMajorClaim 2179 2244\thuman needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important\nT4\tPremise 520 602\tland used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society\nT5\tPremise 626 815\tthe economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy\nT6\tPremise 825 855\tthey produce plenty of profits\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 871 943\tthe society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry\nT8\tPremise 976 1096\tmore farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tClaim 1103 1166\tthe needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important\nA3\tStance T9 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tClaim 1176 1264\tfarmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1296 1413\tfarming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live\nT12\tPremise 1415 1484\tEspecially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing\nT13\tPremise 1499 1614\thighly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nT14\tClaim 1741 1789\tit can do good to protect the endangered animals\nA5\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1660 1739\tfarmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nT16\tPremise 1823 1882\tagriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy\nT17\tPremise 1914 1982\twe can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals\nT18\tPremise 1997 2107\twe can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nEducation plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country\n\nEducation is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.\nIn a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.\nDevelopment through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.\nIn conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 323 400\teducation is the single most important factor in the development of a country\nT2\tMajorClaim 1561 1635\teducation plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country\nT3\tClaim 1637 1717\tThe more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 873 950\tthese children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 402 479\tIn a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school\nT6\tPremise 481 612\tThere are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities\nT7\tPremise 614 685\tThey are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands\nT8\tPremise 687 858\tThese children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tPremise 1065 1116\tBasic education teaches one child to read and write\nT10\tPremise 1118 1192\tSupplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information\nT11\tPremise 1194 1305\tA further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient\nT12\tPremise 1307 1367\tA well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment\nT13\tPremise 1386 1453\ta skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society\nT14\tClaim 1469 1544\tthe benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country\nA3\tStance T14 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T14 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCompetition or co-operation-which is better\n\nThe modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.\nCo-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.\nNevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.\nUnfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.\nHowever, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.\nThus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2055 2133\tchildren should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition\nT2\tClaim 375 413\tCo-operation is essential for teamwork\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 415 493\tEducational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children\nT4\tPremise 495 570\tWe live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success\nT5\tPremise 572 627\tA person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself\nT6\tPremise 643 663\tlions hunt in a team\nT7\tPremise 665 751\tIt is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 770 850\tco-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T2\t\nT9\tClaim 866 946\tco-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes\nA2\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 948 1021\tIt helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others\nT11\tPremise 1023 1131\tA co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements\nT12\tPremise 1142 1190\tcompetition is also as important as co-operation\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nT13\tClaim 1419 1465\tCompetition helps in improvement and evolution\nA3\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1273 1351\tAn individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others\nT15\tPremise 1353 1417\tCompetition has helped the development of science and technology\nT16\tPremise 1480 1569\tevery other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others\nT17\tPremise 1571 1624\tThis kind of competition gives customers more options\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nT18\tClaim 1761 1820\tCompetition should be always based on self-improvement rule\nA4\tStance T18 Against\nT19\tPremise 1635 1679\tblind and selfish competition is detrimental\nT20\tPremise 1681 1759\t'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run\nT21\tPremise 1822 1916\tA healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T18\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T18\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T13 END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould high school make music lessons compulsory\n\nMost people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.\nIt is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.\nBy contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.\nIn conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1999 2093\tAn integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory\nT2\tClaim 1946 1997\tmusic can help an individual to shape its character\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tClaim 387 455\tmany university authorities provide music lessons for their students\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 464 507\tthey live and study in a harmony with music\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 267 374\tIt is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tPremise 535 695\tstudents, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time\nT7\tPremise 711 757\tmusic can be a useful and interesting solution\nT8\tPremise 769 934\tif musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life\nT9\tPremise 945 1024\tstudents with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music\nT10\tPremise 1040 1089\tthe calm atmosphere in the class might be created\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T3\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T3\t\nT11\tPremise 1104 1179\tit is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students\nT12\tClaim 1528 1584\tmusic and other entertaining subjects should be optional\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1586 1655\tNowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace\nT14\tPremise 1669 1807\tstudents are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT15\tPremise 1426 1515\tstudents can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nT16\tPremise 1343 1402\tmusic is the art which requires special attitude towards it\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T12\t\nT17\tPremise 1210 1299\tdemand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T12\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12 END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nYoung adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out\n\nAs young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.\nLiving on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.\nAnother advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.\nWhile some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. \nIn a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSmoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places\n\nSmoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.\nFirst of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he\/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.\nFurthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. \nLastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. \nTo conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tPremise 2436 2503\tIt spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health\nT2\tMajorClaim 2516 2652\tit is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it\nT3\tClaim 2370 2434\tsmoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior\nA1\tStance T3 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nT4\tMajorClaim 247 371\tsmoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it\nT5\tClaim 380 488\tsmoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT7\tPremise 730 872\tthe second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself\nT8\tClaim 1154 1202\tsmoking in restaurants should be strictly banned\nA4\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1211 1291\tit makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 887 1010\tif there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked\nT11\tPremise 1028 1141\tsome burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he\/she inhales it\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 513 697\tit is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT6\tClaim 1403 1537\tthe disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nT13\tPremise 1539 1678\tThe smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals\nT14\tPremise 1680 1756\tThis, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity\nT15\tPremise 1765 1842\tfewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nA5\tStance T6 For\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T6\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T6\t\nT16\tPremise 1897 2036\tNot only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation\nT17\tPremise 2149 2217\tmost people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior\nT18\tPremise 2038 2139\tThis is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T18\t\nT19\tPremise 2234 2354\tthe public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader\nT20\tClaim 1853 1895\tsmoking does no good to the smoker himself\nA3\tStance T20 For\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T20\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T20\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T20 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIs image more powerful than the written word?\n\n\"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.\nFirstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.\nLooking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.\nTo conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 378 487\tI agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication\nT2\tMajorClaim 1697 1809\tboth images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words\nT3\tClaim 1105 1200\tit is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 498 541\tpictures can influence the way people think\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 556 661\tnowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking\nT6\tPremise 676 799\tstatistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 816 1007\tthe magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan\nT8\tPremise 1026 1097\timages are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 1236 1307\twritten words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1309 1405\tWith only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images\nT11\tPremise 1420 1499\tthis is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about\nT12\tPremise 1514 1571\tthe primary way of educating students is also by this way\nT13\tPremise 1573 1682\tAcademic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe best way of learning life\n\nLife is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.\nOn one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.\nOn the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.\nAccording to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?\nIn summary, each way learning life has its own benefits.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFollow the New Customs of the New Country or Not?\n\nWhen people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.\nOn one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.\nOn the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.\nAll in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 386 450\tI would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country\nT2\tMajorClaim 2138 2197\tthe immigrants should follow the customs in the new country\nT3\tClaim 465 558\tit will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 560 689\tWhen people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures\nT5\tPremise 691 802\tThe custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture\nT6\tPremise 817 1027\tif one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture\nT7\tPremise 1042 1111\tpeople understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country\nT8\tClaim 1132 1185\tkeeping own customs stably might cause discrimination\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1187 1326\tWhen people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country\nT10\tPremise 1328 1439\tThe local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society\nT11\tPremise 1441 1512\tOne example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969\nT12\tPremise 1514 1579\tThey formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it\nT13\tPremise 1581 1691\tWhile the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working\nT14\tPremise 1702 1768\tbeing much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination\nT15\tPremise 1770 1827\tTheir houses and private cars were buried by local people\nT16\tPremise 1837 1933\tthe locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs\nT17\tPremise 1935 2124\tIf the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T8\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T8\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T8\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T8\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology makes people's lives simpler rather than complicated\n\nBelieve it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.\nFirst, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.\nSecond, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.\nAdmittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. \nBased on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 366 399\tthe convenience it brings is more\nT2\tClaim 303 364\ttechnology may make people's life complicated in some aspects\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 591 684\tWith a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle\nT4\tPremise 701 846\tif you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times\nT5\tClaim 461 589\twhen it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 896 1050\tIn the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers\nT7\tPremise 1052 1147\tWith the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards\nT8\tPremise 1163 1295\tall the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once\nT9\tClaim 856 894\ttechnology also makes teaching simpler\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1390 1559\tthe cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications\nT11\tPremise 1575 1691\tfolks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them\nT12\tPremise 1706 1837\tgames on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones\nT13\tPremise 1853 1897\tmaking their life more complicated and tired\nT14\tClaim 1325 1375\ttechnology may make people's life more complicated\nT15\tClaim 1985 2044\ttechnology may make people's life complicated in some cases\nA6\tStance T15 Against\nT16\tMajorClaim 2046 2099\tthe convenience it brings in people's are significant\nA5\tStance T14 Against\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T14\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nBest way to judge about people is to be familiar with their personality - not with their look\n\nIndividuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.\nFirst of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.\nSecond of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nComputers have made life easier\n\nThe advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. \nFirst, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. \nSecond, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. \nFinally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 332 386\tcomputers brought convenience and easiness to our life\nT2\tClaim 393 479\tthey enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 1018 1127\twith the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources\nT4\tPremise 555 686\tThrough computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed\nT5\tPremise 688 846\tSearch engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes\nT6\tPremise 848 1009\tSocial networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments\nT7\tClaim 489 553\tcomputers through internet made our access to information easier\nA3\tStance T7 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 1138 1229\tin a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper\nT9\tPremise 1231 1336\tWith the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes\nT10\tPremise 1351 1367\tit is convenient\nT11\tPremise 1376 1572\tyou do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 1574 1647\tInternet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible\nT13\tPremise 1662 1807\tvia skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tClaim 1820 1871\tcommunication has become cheaper, faster and visual\nA5\tStance T14 For\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T14\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nT15\tMajorClaim 1898 1949\tcomputers have made life easier and more convenient\nT16\tClaim 1967 2102\tit broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways\nA6\tStance T16 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T14 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDetailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society\n\nNowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.\nIt is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.\nAn even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.\nMost importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.\nIn conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 249 315\tsuch details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether\nT2\tClaim 622 810\ta great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 341 448\tthe press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating\nT4\tPremise 450 606\tThese days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings\nT5\tClaim 1190 1324\twithout the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 1014 1182\tThis may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police\nT7\tPremise 850 1012\tdetailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise\t\nT8\tPremise 1435 1500\tthey have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced\nT9\tPremise 1502 1626\tWithout their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions\nT10\tClaim 1344 1426\tparticular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT11\tMajorClaim 1673 1737\tany descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer\nT12\tClaim 1739 1868\tas they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes\nA4\tStance T12 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUse of CCTV cameras\n\nToday, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.\nFirstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.\nFurthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.\nLooking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.\nTo conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 504 638\tCCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace\nT2\tMajorClaim 2404 2479\tCCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise\nT3\tClaim 2481 2560\tThis is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 2574 2622\tprivacies are lost with the use of these cameras\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 2637 2683\tsafety should be put first in order to be safe\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tClaim 1229 1300\tCCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 649 728\tby having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down\nT8\tPremise 746 877\twhen a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced\nT9\tPremise 907 1080\tin Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight\nT10\tPremise 1097 1204\tas the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nT11\tPremise 1511 1588\tthe installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation\nT12\tClaim 1805 1899\tthese cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1597 1663\tthe customers know very well that their conversations are recorded\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nT14\tPremise 1315 1400\tat some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers\nT15\tPremise 1412 1502\tface-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT16\tClaim 1983 2096\tThose opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras\nA5\tStance T16 Against\nT17\tPremise 2107 2251\tone must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences\nT18\tPremise 2259 2389\topponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tPremise 1694 1793\tthe videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T12\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose\n\nSome people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.\nFirst of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.\nSecondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.\nLast but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. \nIn conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 260 298\tthe zoo is invaluable for human beings\nT2\tClaim 300 331\tIt is very crucial for learning\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 333 367\tIt helps animals out of extinction\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 375 410\tit is a interesting travel location\nA3\tStance T4 For\nT5\tClaim 426 460\tthe zoo gives humans new knowledge\nA4\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 583 633\tthe zoo is the important place for innate learning\nT7\tPremise 635 706\tThe zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically\nT8\tPremise 708 764\tThey are able to observe animals' behaviors and features\nT9\tPremise 776 842\tpractical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class\nT10\tPremise 853 934\tresearchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches\nT11\tPremise 943 976\tit has diverse species of animals\nT12\tClaim 988 1068\tthe zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats\nA5\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1070 1117\tIn the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest\nT14\tPremise 1119 1179\tThey, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves\nT15\tPremise 1194 1263\twe can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife\nT16\tPremise 1285 1384\tbecause of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction\nT17\tPremise 1386 1451\tThere are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely\nT18\tPremise 1453 1559\tIf the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money\nT19\tClaim 1622 1654\tIt benefits to a certain country\nA7\tStance T19 For\nT20\tPremise 1561 1620\tThat also make money flow, and then economics become better\nT21\tClaim 1672 1784\tthe zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives\nA8\tStance T21 For\nT22\tMajorClaim 1808 1842\tthe zoo is so useful for the earth\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T5\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T19\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T19\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T19\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T19 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nRoommates quality and their importance\n\nMuch has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. \nConsideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.\nMoreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.\nIn conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1633 1720\tConsideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality\nT2\tMajorClaim 315 374\tthe most important quality of roommates is being considered\nT3\tMajorClaim 393 465\tcommunication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate\nT4\tPremise 468 517\tConsideration is always important in relationship\nT5\tPremise 532 596\troommate turns down the music or television volume at night time\nT6\tPremise 598 684\tSometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine\nT7\tPremise 686 830\tAt all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously\nT8\tClaim 843 918\thaving a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life\nA2\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 920 1004\tIt will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1016 1063\tcommunication is as well making a good roommate\nT11\tPremise 1456 1549\tThrough communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others\nT12\tClaim 1380 1411\tcommunication is very important\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1065 1147\tPeople have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning\nT14\tPremise 1149 1237\tOne might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project\nT15\tPremise 1239 1367\tIf one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR18\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T8\t\nT16\tPremise 1415 1454\tit would clear up the misinterpretation\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudents should be required to take regular standardized tests\n\nThe issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.\nFirstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.\nAdditionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.\nFinally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don't because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.\nUltimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 255 403\tstandardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge\nT2\tMajorClaim 1822 1896\tschools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right\nT3\tClaim 1934 2033\tthese schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 637 721\texams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students\nT5\tClaim 414 447\tstandardized tests are preferable\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT7\tPremise 530 624\tsome students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue\nT8\tPremise 736 803\tmany teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class\nT9\tPremise 808 871\tthe usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them\nT6\tPremise 983 1065\tsome students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard\nT10\tPremise 1070 1120\tthey will never try to solve problems on their own\nT11\tPremise 1131 1172\tstandardized tests offer them such chance\nT12\tClaim 1197 1299\tschools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides\nA2\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 887 974\tstandardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice\nT14\tClaim 1323 1381\trequirement to take standardized tests is the right choice\nA4\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1389 1467\tin this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students\nT16\tPremise 1469 1594\tIn any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively\nT17\tPremise 1639 1691\tstandardized tests are required over those who don't\nT18\tPremise 1700 1797\tif the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them\nT19\tPremise 469 516\tthey help teachers to fairly grade the students\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T5\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working\n\nIn everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.\nFirst, the core of group working is \"consensus\". It's the idea that everyone's opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his\/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.\nSecond, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: \"The good medicine tastes bitter\". Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.\nHowever, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.\nIn conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 310 382\tpeople who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working\nT2\tPremise 871 948\tthe work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member\nT3\tPremise 760 862\tIt doesn't work if one member solely insists on his\/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nT4\tPremise 950 1001\tIt's every member's duty to respect other's opinion\nT5\tClaim 432 472\tthe core of group working is \"consensus\"\nA1\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 474 520\tIt's the idea that everyone's opinion accounts\nT7\tPremise 522 674\tIn group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tPremise 1173 1199\tCriticism definitely hurts\nT9\tPremise 1208 1268\tit points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 1279 1367\tcriticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it\nT11\tClaim 1091 1171\tEven if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism\nA2\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1011 1089\ttaking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tPremise 1369 1459\tThose who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT14\tPremise 1477 1606\tif you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works\nT15\tPremise 1608 1668\tAs one Chinese idiom goes: \"The good medicine tastes bitter\"\nT16\tPremise 1670 1723\tCriticism might be the most powerful solution to heal\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T11\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T11\t\nT17\tClaim 1966 2015\teven if you are right, criticism is still helpful\nA3\tStance T17 For\nT18\tPremise 2024 2139\tin this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work\nT19\tPremise 2141 2209\tTaking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all\nT20\tPremise 2211 2249\tYou should have your own judgments too\nT21\tPremise 2251 2305\tAnd it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T17\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T17\t\nT22\tMajorClaim 2322 2419\tcriticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSuccessful people do something new or take risks\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.\nThe first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.\nMoreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.\nAdmittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 493 544\tsuccessful people still do things they already know\nT2\tMajorClaim 2391 2448\tdoing what we already known can still leads us to succeed\nT3\tClaim 2457 2528\tthe advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 608 674\tto be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter\nT5\tPremise 676 762\tThe lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own\nT6\tPremise 764 865\tConsider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment\nT7\tPremise 867 999\tHe can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income\nT8\tPremise 1001 1122\tHe does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time\nT9\tClaim 1165 1226\tsuccessful people do not have to try new things or take risks\nA3\tStance T9 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tClaim 1836 1891\tit is not necessary for successful people to take risks\nA2\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1277 1352\tit depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not\nT12\tPremise 1364 1450\ta successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success\nT13\tPremise 1466 1562\tthe sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills\nT14\tPremise 1564 1661\tThe same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm\nT15\tPremise 1676 1780\tthose athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT16\tClaim 1973 2027\tdoing something new is necessary for people to success\nA4\tStance T16 Against\nT17\tPremise 2036 2123\tthey can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success\nT18\tPremise 2242 2297\tTry something new can indeed make people become special\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tPremise 2299 2332\twhile it does not mean successful\nR13\tattacks Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nUniversities require students to study many subjects or specialize in one subject\n\nUniversity is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.\nFirst of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.\nIn addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.\nFinally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.\nIn concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 328 369\tstudying many subjects is better that one\nT2\tClaim 378 531\tstudents can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1831 1913\tlearning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject\nT4\tClaim 1922 2039\tit makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 547 677\twhen students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities\nT6\tPremise 695 757\tthey interested in many subjects and they want to try them all\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 772 832\tpupil who want to study science are also like to learn music\nT8\tClaim 845 906\trequiring students to study in many subjects is good for them\nA3\tStance T8 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tPremise 1292 1347\tthey all can share opinion and knowledge to one another\nT10\tClaim 921 992\tpeople who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one\nA5\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 994 1064\tStudents can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study\nT12\tPremise 1080 1153\tuniversity students who study business are also know history of the world\nT13\tPremise 1168 1235\tstudents not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience\nT14\tPremise 1244 1283\tthey will meet new friends and teachers\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nT15\tClaim 1358 1517\tstudents who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career\nA4\tStance T15 For\nT16\tPremise 1535 1618\tgraduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer\nT17\tPremise 1633 1720\tstudents will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nT18\tPremise 1732 1814\tbachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mail\n\nWhen it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. \nFirstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. \nSecondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. \nAdmittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. \nWhile we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 218 244\twok in person is preferred\nT2\tClaim 253 300\tthis means help to achieve a good communication\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 413 479\tdiscussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 312 400\tteam members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 481 594\tAn experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity\nT6\tPremise 596 696\tThe first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email\nT7\tPremise 720 829\tthe 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one\nT8\tPremise 831 974\tThe similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tPremise 1079 1141\tthere will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members\nT10\tPremise 1143 1219\tWriting an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official\nT11\tPremise 1231 1324\tpeople who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing\nT12\tClaim 1547 1659\tless misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members\nT13\tPremise 1422 1534\ttheir response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim\nT14\tPremise 1332 1415\tif the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed\nT15\tPremise 987 1070\twork in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T15\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nA3\tStance T12 For\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nT16\tClaim 1770 1835\temails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none\nA4\tStance T16 Against\nT17\tPremise 1674 1759\tsometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nT18\tPremise 1843 1961\tit is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas\nR13\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tMajorClaim 2213 2280\tI prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email\nT20\tClaim 2289 2326\twork in person will be more efficient\nA5\tStance T20 For\nT21\tClaim 1970 2196\twe should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience\nA6\tStance T21 For END"}

Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. \nIn the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.\nWhat is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.\nFinally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPeople should create a sense of co-operation in their children\n\nIt is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:\nCompetitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.\nHowever, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.\nIn my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.\nTo conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1724 1830\tpeople should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life\nT2\tPremise 858 1006\tMNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team\nT3\tClaim 409 507\tCompetitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 737 801\tThis factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T2 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 1173 1256\tthey will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do\nT6\tClaim 1262 1349\tthey shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team\nR3\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 1017 1161\tthose who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead\nA2\tStance T6 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 1373 1476\tcompetitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level\nT9\tClaim 1571 1692\tco-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1482 1546\tit will not help them to be on the success path for the long run\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe tax reduction of state school for parents who have children studying in private system\n\nSome people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.\nFirstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.\nSecondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.\nMany parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.\nOn the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 267 303\tthese taxes are absolutely essential\nT2\tClaim 314 435\tby paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 453 541\tmany poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course\nT4\tPremise 543 729\tWith the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tPremise 863 925\tthis reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation\nT6\tPremise 938 1038\tthe government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 1053 1237\tthe government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care\nT8\tClaim 741 850\tthe tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital\nA2\tStance T8 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tMajorClaim 1662 1791\ttaxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in\nT10\tClaim 1304 1341\tsuch tax payments are unfair for them\nA3\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tPremise 1363 1432\tit is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use\nT12\tPremise 1448 1561\twe also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade\nT13\tPremise 1563 1628\tWe certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOnce you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success\n\nAchieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.\nFirst, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.\nSecond, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.\nIn conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 391 456\tonce you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success\nT2\tClaim 701 872\tIf you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 899 977\twhen I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report\nT4\tPremise 986 1069\tI was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tPremise 465 584\tbeing positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others\nT6\tPremise 586 653\tAs living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game\nT7\tPremise 655 699\tOnly who has the sharpest weapon can survive\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nT8\tPremise 1345 1421\tTake the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example\nT9\tPremise 1423 1569\tThe reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors\nT11\tPremise 1571 1704\tIt has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers\nT10\tPremise 1706 1769\tIt is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tClaim 1079 1152\tbeing unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others\nA2\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1170 1343\tonce you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tMajorClaim 1786 1849\tbeing different and unique is the better way to achieve success\nT15\tClaim 1851 1970\tIt not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success\nA3\tStance T15 For END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLearning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives\n\nThere are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.\nFirst, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. \nSecond, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. \nMoreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. \nAll in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 336 408\tlearning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives\nT2\tPremise 476 599\twhen students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations\nT3\tPremise 621 733\tmore information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts\nT4\tClaim 748 835\tthey would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 1099 1234\tif they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life\nT6\tClaim 846 888\tit would improve students' social behavior\nA1\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 890 992\tIf students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well\nT8\tPremise 994 1091\tThey should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well\t\nT9\tPremise 1535 1597\tIt can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position\nT10\tClaim 1352 1451\twhen a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently\nT11\tPremise 1470 1533\tconcerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life\nT12\tPremise 1247 1329\tthese way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts\t\nT13\tMajorClaim 1636 1717\tlearning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life\nT14\tClaim 1758 1903\tStudents would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc\nA4\tStance T14 For\nA5\tStance T10 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10 END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nE-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face\n\nTechnology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.\nEveryone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.\nIn addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nInfluence of large factories\n\nNowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.\nFirst of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.\nThe main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.\nHowever, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.\nIn conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nBusinesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life\n\nMany entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. \nFirst and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.\nSecondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. \nLast but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. \nIn a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nProhibit public smoking?\n\nThe awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.\nFirstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.\nSecondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafes, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.\nTo sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation.

In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.\nIt is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. \nHowever, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDistance-learning vs. attending school in person\n\nA matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.\nTo begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.\nNevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.\nBy way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGossip-based information\n\nNowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: \"information is power\". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.\nThe first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.\nSecondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the \"salt-panic\" was over. \nTo conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 166 186\tinformation is power\nT2\tClaim 329 403\tby using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability\nT3\tPremise 405 541\tSome people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information\nT4\tPremise 556 714\tRussian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia\nT5\tPremise 716 833\tAfter a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia\nA1\tStance T2 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tMajorClaim 1662 1804\tit is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence\nT7\tClaim 1096 1184\tyou have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1186 1225\tIt is possible to make a wrong decision\nT9\tPremise 1234 1333\tyou have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong\nT10\tPremise 1348 1499\tseveral years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops\nT11\tPremise 1501 1627\tThe gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the \"salt-panic\" was over\nT12\tPremise 845 930\tit is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations\nT13\tPremise 940 995\tit can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nImprove roads or public transports\n\nMany people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.\nFirst, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.\nSecond, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.\nLast but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.\nIn short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 223 299\tgovernments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system\nT2\tClaim 308 386\tit would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 395 485\tthe using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 558 634\tthe more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up\nT5\tPremise 487 545\tCars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 653 765\tif the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower\nT7\tPremise 771 845\tthis definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tClaim 855 918\tpublic transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 931 1005\tpublic transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars\nT10\tPremise 1007 1194\tIt means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT11\tPremise 1216 1285\tusing public transportation is much safer than private transportation\nT12\tPremise 1287 1381\tAccording to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care\nT13\tClaim 1388 1526\tthere is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting\nA5\tStance T13 For\nT14\tMajorClaim 1565 1627\tspending money on improving public transportation is necessary\nT15\tClaim 1636 1733\tit is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in\nA6\tStance T15 For\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology designed to make people's lives simpler often make them more complicated\n\nMany people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.\nOf course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. \nNext, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nKeeping animals in zoos\n\nSince the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.\nFirst, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.\nOn the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.\nIn conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1818 1851\tmore good come from zoos than bad\nT2\tClaim 1754 1796\tboth of the arguments have strong supports\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tClaim 366 403\tkeeping animals in captivity is wrong\nA2\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 412 507\tanimals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 509 615\tThis is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures\nT6\tPremise 634 751\tmany zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tPremise 753 858\tThe animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment\nT8\tPremise 873 967\tsometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 1016 1114\tzoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1116 1294\tMany people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world\nT11\tPremise 1296 1383\tZoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public\nT12\tPremise 1391 1502\tzoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life\nT13\tPremise 1534 1687\tin zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tPremise 1694 1737\tzoos are needed to keep the nature balanced\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTelevision has more bad than good in respect of bonds with family and friends\n\nThere are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.\nTo begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show \"Infinete Challenges\". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.\nMoreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 365 398\ttelevision has more bad than good\nT2\tClaim 407 461\tit has made people not to have conversation each other\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 628 708\tthey cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time\nT4\tPremise 540 620\tOne who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air\nT5\tPremise 715 768\tthey think the programs are so crucial to their lives\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tPremise 770 924\tOne of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show \"Infinete Challenges\"\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tPremise 926 1066\tThis is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other\nT8\tPremise 1077 1174\twatching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 478 538\ttelevision shows make people forget what is really important\nA2\tStance T9 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tPremise 1402 1494\tit is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness\nT11\tPremise 1303 1394\tWatching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 1520 1630\tit is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together\nT13\tPremise 1632 1669\tIt is natural they behave in that way\nT14\tPremise 1678 1726\ttelevision shows don't require any participation\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nT15\tClaim 1186 1301\teven when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television\nA3\tStance T15 For\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tMajorClaim 1765 1907\tit is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward\nT17\tClaim 1909 2008\tIt is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close\nA4\tStance T17 For END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGun control \n\nGun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.\nThe first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.\nSecondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.\nThirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.\nIn conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 282 323\tit is sensible to enforce the gun control\nT2\tMajorClaim 1577 1702\tthe guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence\nT3\tClaim 1483 1560\tconsidering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 730 848\tmost violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 862 919\tguns will create a violent society if the trend continues\nT6\tPremise 938 1058\tin American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting\nT7\tPremise 1075 1192\tsome terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tClaim 599 718\tthe fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates\nA4\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 389 491\tThe accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 506 594\twe hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT11\tClaim 1203 1261\tthe possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide\nA5\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1263 1357\tIn the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent\nT13\tPremise 1374 1466\tthere is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nFossil fuels will soon be replaced?\n\nAlthough renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.\nFirstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.\nBesides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.\nAdmittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCreativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions\n\nCreativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.\nTime and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.\nNonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.\nUnfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, \"Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open\". Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.\nHowever, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 225 315\tcreative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions\nT2\tClaim 180 216\tCreativity originates in a free mind\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1786 1835\tartists should be given the freedom of expression\nT4\tClaim 619 692\tCreative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 317 464\tTime and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message\nT6\tPremise 466 617\tRight from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT7\tClaim 707 804\tinnovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 806 880\tIt helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments\nT9\tPremise 896 1014\tBangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue\nT10\tPremise 1016 1077\tThis type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds\nT11\tPremise 1092 1129\tcreativity also gives aesthetic charm\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT12\tClaim 1364 1450\tLike the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1185 1267\tFrank Zappa once said, \"Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open\"\nT14\tPremise 1269 1362\tRestrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT15\tClaim 1837 1887\tMind can not work when it is chained in boundaries\nA5\tStance T15 For\nT16\tClaim 1889 2001\tImagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws\nA6\tStance T16 For\nT17\tClaim 1650 1762\tArtists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose\nA7\tStance T17 For\nT18\tPremise 1461 1526\tartists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people\nT19\tPremise 1528 1648\tMany artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nStudy at school or get a job?\n\nMany people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.\nFirst of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.\nNevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.\nOverall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 337 381\tstudent have to be forced to study at school\nT2\tMajorClaim 1541 1572\tstudents should study at school\nT3\tClaim 1586 1643\tthere are some advantages of leaving school to find a job\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 1645 1711\tstudying at school is always the best choice for children's future\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 1713 1820\tThere are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job\nR2\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tClaim 837 914\tthey have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 941 1027\temployer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 397 508\tschools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying\nT9\tPremise 680 734\tschools provide lots of academic knowledge to students\nT10\tPremise 736 824\tStudents may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences\nT11\tPremise 510 663\tIt creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nT12\tClaim 1094 1151\tchildren should interrupt their school work and get a job\nA3\tStance T12 Against\nT13\tPremise 1153 1195\tWhether children can learn a lot at school\nT14\tPremise 1197 1271\tthere are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT15\tPremise 1286 1339\tchildren can learn social skills when they have a job\nT16\tPremise 1341 1405\tThey can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school\nT17\tPremise 1407 1515\tWorking helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T12\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T12 END"}

Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.\nFirstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.\nSecondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.\nFinally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. \nTo conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLarge amount of violence in television programs\n\nExcessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today.

However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children's television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.\nNevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults' civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. \nIn conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 306 491\tgovernments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable\nT2\tMajorClaim 1800 1908\tviolent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency\nT3\tPremise 506 615\treducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate\nT4\tPremise 676 774\tgovernments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children's television programs\nT5\tPremise 776 874\tAs a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong\nT6\tPremise 902 1046\tby watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes\nT7\tClaim 1059 1216\tit would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies\nA1\tStance T7 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 1420 1500\tadults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day\nT9\tPremise 1502 1581\tFor whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment\nT10\tPremise 1583 1761\tConsidering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them\nT11\tClaim 1232 1406\tit would certainly be a violation of adults' civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences\nA3\tStance T11 Against\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T7 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nChildhood is the happiest time of a person's life\n\nI agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.\nStarting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. \nAnother great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.\nUsing your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.\nChildhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 83 129\tchildhood is the happiest period of one's life\nT2\tClaim 131 350\tIt's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 615 715\tduring our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 717 864\tBeing late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 352 449\tStarting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives\nT6\tPremise 451 539\tWe are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave\nT7\tPremise 541 609\tEvery action we make are watched closely and judged by the community\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT8\tClaim 1227 1294\tchildhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1123 1214\tThere are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see\nT10\tPremise 867 1002\tAnother great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day\nT11\tPremise 1004 1121\tBeing a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tPremise 1396 1558\tChildren are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination\nT13\tPremise 1560 1627\tIn adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries\nT14\tPremise 1639 1696\tthey are in no way free to think or use their imagination\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nT15\tClaim 1296 1394\tUsing your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child\nA4\tStance T15 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tMajorClaim 1698 1764\tChildhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives\nT17\tClaim 1766 1886\tIt's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults\nA5\tStance T17 For END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nNon academic subjects should be removed from syllabus\n\nStudents have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.\nTo begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students' health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people's health, it will also decrease their learning capability.\nIn addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.\nSome people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student's development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2039 2079\tschools should not remove these subjects\nT2\tClaim 1939 2026\tnon-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student's development\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 354 434\tfrom the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects\nT4\tPremise 436 551\tIf physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students' health\nT5\tPremise 567 814\tafter studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes\nT6\tClaim 816 962\tRemoving physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people's health, it will also decrease their learning capability\nT7\tClaim 1349 1428\tschool education should not only focus on the academic development of a student\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1432 1512\tit is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life\nT9\tPremise 1145 1341\tSuccess in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit\nT10\tPremise 977 1055\tschools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people\nT11\tPremise 1057 1143\tIt is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically\nT12\tClaim 1541 1614\tstudents can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents\nA4\tStance T12 Against\nT13\tPremise 1640 1661\tit is not a good idea\nT14\tPremise 1670 1796\tmost young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents\nT15\tPremise 1808 1898\tparents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills\nT16\tMajorClaim 256 337\tnon-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that\nA5\tStance T6 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTechnology that widen the gap between rich and poor?\n\nTechnology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.\nIn the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.\nSecondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.\nUndoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.\nIn conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2182 2230\tthe good technology bringing to us is undeniable\nT2\tClaim 2232 2343\tUnder proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 953 1068\tmost members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 568 666\tthe progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products\nT5\tPremise 668 814\tAbout ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one\nT6\tPremise 816 945\tToday, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tPremise 1612 1670\tthe Internet gives everyone access to the same information\nT8\tPremise 1672 1732\tthis therefore leads to greater equality between individuals\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT9\tPremise 1251 1366\tWith the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day\nT10\tClaim 1080 1249\ttechnical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life\nT11\tPremise 1386 1503\twe had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us\nT12\tPremise 1515 1597\twe can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us\nA3\tStance T10 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\nT13\tClaim 1824 1883\tthe gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology\nA4\tStance T13 Against\nT14\tPremise 1893 2026\tonly the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return\nT15\tPremise 2050 2165\tit is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nTesting on animals and keeping them in unnatural conditions\n\nPerhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.\nThere are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.\nSecondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.\nThere is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 339 391\tprimates should have the same rights as human beings\nT2\tMajorClaim 1708 1733\tit should be made illegal\nT3\tClaim 1631 1689\tit seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 393 454\tThere are several reasons why animal testing should be banned\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 465 496\tthe costs outweigh the benefits\nT6\tPremise 498 633\tEvery year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result\nT7\tPremise 635 683\tAnimal testing costs an enormous amount of money\nT8\tPremise 691 768\tthey must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 1150 1206\tsacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 780 820\tanimals are kept in unnatural conditions\nT11\tPremise 822 935\tRecent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs\nT12\tPremise 937 1121\tIn March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT13\tPremise 1422 1478\tanimals and people's response to a drug can be different\nT14\tClaim 1506 1596\thuman beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual\nT15\tPremise 1335 1414\tit is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T15\t\nA4\tStance T14 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14 END"}

So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.\nFirstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould good people are rewarded and bad people are punished in movies or dramas?\n\nWhen we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don't think it's proper.\nFirst, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don't want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can't always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.\nEven in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSome students prefer to study alone\n\nEveryone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.\nStudying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.\nAdditionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. \nTo conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nSalary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways\n\nIt is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.\nFirstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.\nSecondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. \nThirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.\nIn conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nMore people are migrating to other countries than ever before\n\nThe last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries' cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.\nFirstly, maintaining one's cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one's pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.\nSecondly, it is crucial to keep one's identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.\nTo conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one's cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 391 489\tthey are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values\nT2\tMajorClaim 1936 2077\tsustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society\nT3\tPremise 500 624\tmaintaining one's cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments\nT4\tClaim 1089 1156\tsustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 626 839\tTake Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues\nT6\tPremise 841 946\tMany Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values\nT7\tPremise 948 1057\tThese feedbacks, in turn, help raise one's pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more\nT8\tPremise 1168 1204\tit is crucial to keep one's identity\nT9\tPremise 1209 1307\tthey need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin\nT10\tClaim 1711 1795\tkeeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1323 1412\tchildren immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends\nT12\tPremise 1414 1571\tIn this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home\nT13\tPremise 1573 1685\tFail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nT14\tClaim 1819 1908\tthere are opposing ideas of neglecting one's cultural values to adapt in the new cultures\nA5\tStance T14 Against\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nOld and young workers\n\nThroughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.\nFirst and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.\nSecondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.\nLast but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.\nAll in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nWe can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject\n\nThere is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.\nOn one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.\nFurthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.\nOn the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.\nIn conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 254 318\tmany different characters exist between male and female students\nA1\tStance T1 For\nT2\tMajorClaim 1751 1951\tit is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject\nT3\tPremise 409 541\tMost of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases\nT4\tPremise 557 645\tthere are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world\nT5\tPremise 647 767\tMany boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts\nT6\tPremise 778 897\tgirls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter\nT7\tPremise 915 1035\tgirls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect\nT8\tClaim 333 407\tboys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1260 1343\ta girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department\nT10\tClaim 1050 1163\tit can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender\nA4\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1169 1245\tthat does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development\nT12\tClaim 1484 1589\tuniversities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities\nA5\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1595 1648\tthis could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects\nT14\tPremise 1650 1734\tIt would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender\nT15\tPremise 1349 1388\tshe is unlikely to focus on her subject\nT16\tPremise 1394 1463\tthis also can block the girl's future development and career prospect\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T8\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T10 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nThe best way to relax is by exercises\n\nIn modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.\nIt is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.\nSports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould animals be free or live in zoos?\n\nMany people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.\nMany scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. \nIn addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGun control and increasing violence\n\nSome people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. \nFirst of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. \nIn fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. \nMoreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. \nAll in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nDo guns can really increase the level of violence?\n\nThe number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.\nOn the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.\nOn the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1570 1655\tthe guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence\nT2\tPremise 737 836\tthey have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public\nT3\tClaim 851 965\tsome military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 400 496\ta police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun\nT5\tPremise 498 665\tAn obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him\nT6\tPremise 678 727\tpolice officers can force a criminal to surrender\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tPremise 1085 1191\tthe number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries\nT8\tPremise 1193 1280\tMany well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably\nT9\tPremise 1292 1456\tcost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs\nT10\tPremise 1458 1533\tMany baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance\nT11\tClaim 986 1074\tthere are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities\nA2\tStance T11 For\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nCapital punishment is necessary or not?\n\nCapital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, \"murdering\" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.\nFirst of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.\nSecondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.\nThe third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.\nIn conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nGender Equality at university admission\n\nNowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.\nUniversities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. \nHowever, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1498 1562\tuniversities must open choice for everyone to select his subject\nT2\tClaim 1774 1825\twe must give them opportunity to achieve their goal\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 1564 1618\tOur youth has become very confident towards his career\nT4\tPremise 1620 1673\tThey are not ready to be bound in certain limitations\nT5\tPremise 1675 1769\tFemale candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tClaim 407 475\tUniversities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 514 589\twomen have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor\nT8\tPremise 604 660\tnowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky\nT9\tPremise 662 729\tThey are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also\nT10\tPremise 744 822\tuniversity authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination\nT11\tPremise 824 907\tThey must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nT12\tClaim 1357 1459\tuniversities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender\nA3\tStance T12 Against\nT13\tPremise 919 978\tthe current job market affects the decision of universities\nT14\tPremise 980 1051\tEvery university designs its courses according to the need of employers\nT15\tPremise 1053 1095\tThe job selection criteria are pre decided\nT16\tPremise 1110 1211\temployers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine\nT17\tPremise 1213 1252\tThey prefer male staff for night shifts\nT18\tPremise 1254 1344\tThey want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T12 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nReading fictions is more pleasant\n\nThere are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.\nFirstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.\nSecondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.\nSome people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.\nTo sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 144 198\treading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies\nT2\tMajorClaim 1729 1762\treading fictions is more pleasant\nT3\tClaim 1771 1861\tthese books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 235 278\tfiction books pay more attention to details\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 289 369\twe can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it\nT6\tPremise 371 490\tMost of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening\nT7\tPremise 505 646\tafter I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people\nT8\tPremise 657 728\ta movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 740 774\treading a novel is more convenient\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 776 857\tSome novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour\nT11\tPremise 859 963\tYet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains\nT12\tPremise 978 1024\tI have started to read a novel since last week\nT13\tPremise 1026 1141\tI do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class\nT14\tPremise 1156 1187\tI cannot watch a complete movie\nT15\tPremise 1196 1272\tI can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T9\t\nT16\tClaim 1303 1327\tpeople enjoy watching TV\nA4\tStance T16 Against\nT17\tPremise 1343 1416\tthey can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nT18\tPremise 1470 1530\tmovies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners\nR12\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tPremise 1537 1607\tcharacters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nT20\tPremise 1609 1716\tFor these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T18 END"}

Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.\nFirst and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. \nIn addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.\nIn conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T3\tMajorClaim 328 397\tgovernments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment\nT4\tClaim 484 578\tthey help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air\nA1\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 399 473\tSuch public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT1\tClaim 1244 1353\tthe policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth\nA2\tStance T1 For\nT2\tPremise 1086 1231\tif there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T1\t\nT6\tPremise 637 713\tcarbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere\nT7\tPremise 732 820\tthe more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged\nT8\tPremise 822 945\tIf governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work\nT9\tClaim 947 1075\tThis is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment\nA4\tStance T9 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tPremise 1554 1607\tthere are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads\nT11\tPremise 1432 1513\tIt is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities\nT12\tClaim 1641 1732\tgovernments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes\nT13\tPremise 1734 1853\tThere is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion\nT14\tPremise 1369 1430\tthe policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam\nT15\tClaim 1891 1952\thigh-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around\nA5\tStance T15 Against\nT16\tMajorClaim 1968 2033\tpublic transportation systems even have more important advantages\nT17\tClaim 2035 2097\tThey not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere\nA6\tStance T17 For\nA3\tStance T12 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPrepared Food\n\nNowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.\nFirst of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.\nNot cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.\nIn addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.\nIn conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T3\tMajorClaim 193 383\tit is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits\nT4\tClaim 104 183\tit can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society\nA2\tStance T4 Against\nT5\tClaim 911 977\teasy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 501 676\tto make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people\nT7\tPremise 683 736\tingredients being added have caused dire consequences\nT8\tPremise 752 903\tthere are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT9\tClaim 979 1041\tNot cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition\nA4\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1137 1295\tWhereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT1\tClaim 1745 1850\tthe invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nT2\tMajorClaim 1852 1874\tit is not a good thing\nT11\tClaim 1348 1409\tThe more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose\nA5\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1411 1558\tAt the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes\nT13\tPremise 1564 1719\trare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11 END"}

I will discuss my view in two main areas.\nIn the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.\nMoreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nShould teenagers learn all school subjects\/focus on one subject\n\nPresently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.\nThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.\nThose who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.\nIt is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2002 2055\tI do support the view of learning all school subjects\nT2\tClaim 1827 1989\tconcentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 475 546\tThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 568 691\twith some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future\nT5\tPremise 693 777\tTeenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate\nT6\tPremise 779 926\tIn students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes\nT7\tPremise 937 1080\tstill many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done\nT8\tPremise 1091 1177\tmost students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tattacks Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 1235 1353\tthis education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness\nA3\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 1380 1476\tstudents can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects\nT11\tPremise 1564 1725\tunder such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nT12\tPremise 1737 1803\tthe dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9 END"}
{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nPrevention is better than cure\n\nIt is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.\nHealth education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.\nPreventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 32 159\tIt is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment\nT2\tMajorClaim 1801 1893\twe should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment\nT3\tClaim 1904 2017\treasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tClaim 237 311\tHealth education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 1091 1167\tPreventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens\nT6\tPremise 327 499\tthank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences\nT7\tPremise 514 614\tif a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older\nT8\tPremise 626 751\thealth education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases\nT9\tPremise 753 895\tInstead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes\nT10\tPremise 897 995\tMany diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment\nT11\tPremise 997 1089\tHealth education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T11\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T4\t\nT12\tPremise 1182 1326\tvaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on\nT13\tPremise 1328 1452\tWhen huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably\nT14\tPremise 1457 1520\thuman resources play a key role in the development of a country\nT15\tClaim 1522 1601\tinvesting money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision\nT16\tPremise 1624 1690\tthe cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention\nT17\tPremise 1692 1762\tthe government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T17\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nA4\tStance T15 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T5\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T5\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T15\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T15 END"}

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nIt is essential to have ability to plan and organize\n\nWith the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.\nFirst of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.\nEqually important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.\nFinally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs.

{"prompt":"Analyse the following essay:\n\nLiving in smal towns\n\nPlace of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.\nFirstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.\nSecondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.\nIn conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 258 296\tI would prefer to live in a small town\nT2\tClaim 301 401\tI think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1568 1600\tI prefer to live in a small town\nT4\tClaim 1613 1737\tit has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 1739 1821\tIn small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities\nT6\tPremise 1832 1898\ton big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT7\tPremise 1935 2018\tpeople in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tPremise 412 512\tthe first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items\nT9\tPremise 514 626\tOne of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town\nT10\tPremise 634 689\tin a small town there are less crowded and less traffic\nT11\tPremise 691 870\tLiving in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness\nT12\tPremise 882 995\tin a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits\nT13\tClaim 1028 1100\tit is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities\nA4\tStance T13 For\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nT14\tClaim 1112 1160\tanother advantage of small towns is living costs\nA5\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1162 1289\tLiving cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities\nT16\tPremise 1302 1364\tin a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes\nT17\tPremise 1371 1443\tbecause of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services\nT18\tPremise 1445 1516\tTransportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic\nT19\tPremise 1525 1551\twe can save time and money\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T19\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR17\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T14\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T13 END"}
