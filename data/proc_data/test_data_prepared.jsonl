{"prompt":"Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past\n\nThe modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.\nTo start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the \"weaker\" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.\nIn the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.\nAdmittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.\nAll things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 242 311\tThis, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society\nT3\tClaim 544 680\tWomen nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 698 902\tthe \"weaker\" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields\nT5\tPremise 432 542\tGone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children\nT6\tPremise 350 430\tthe fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 925 1032\tthe revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1034 1168\tThe financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money\nT2\tMajorClaim 1755 1900\tin a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles\nT9\tPremise 1184 1326\twomen have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nT10\tClaim 1340 1422\tsuch changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate\nA3\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tPremise 1453 1538\twomen find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 1546 1627\tchildren might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The Internet is an adequate source of academic information\n\nOver the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.\nFirst and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.\nIn the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.\nCritics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.\nAfter analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 536 608\tthe Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning\nT2\tMajorClaim 2279 2354\tI would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process\nT3\tClaim 630 751\tthe Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 753 902\tNowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace\nT5\tPremise 913 978\tthe Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever\nT6\tPremise 990 1068\twith the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance\nT7\tPremise 1070 1220\tCollege students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries\nT8\tPremise 1242 1311\tthe Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying\nT9\tPremise 1313 1480\tWhile virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query\nT10\tClaim 1502 1569\tthe Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training\nA2\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1748 1826\tThis fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances\nT12\tPremise 1619 1746\tHave you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously\nT13\tClaim 1851 1979\tthe Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs\nA3\tStance T13 Against\nT14\tPremise 2018 2126\tthese problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself\nT15\tPremise 2134 2240\twhat we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR10\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Studies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience\n\nStudying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.\nFirst of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. \nOne other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.\nMost important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. \nIn conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way.

{"prompt":"Parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life\n\nLearning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.\nFirstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.\nSecondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.\nThirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 243 302\tno one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers\nT2\tPremise 602 730\twhen we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives\nT3\tPremise 454 590\tAs we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating\nT4\tClaim 391 452\tparents are our teachers from the very early time in our life\nA1\tStance T4 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nT5\tClaim 1087 1139\twe will never forget what our parents have taught us\nT6\tPremise 1148 1167\twe use it every day\nT7\tPremise 1182 1288\tI believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me\nT8\tPremise 742 847\tat school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents\nT9\tPremise 864 933\twe spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school\nT10\tPremise 943 1062\twhen we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life\nA3\tStance T5 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T5\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nT11\tClaim 1382 1573\teven when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life\nA2\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1317 1369\tparents love their sons or daughters unconditionally\nT13\tPremise 1589 1768\tmy older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nT14\tMajorClaim 1807 1836\tparents are our best teachers\n"}
{"prompt":"Reading fictions is more pleasant\n\nThere are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.\nFirstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.\nSecondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.\nSome people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.\nTo sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 144 198\treading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies\nT2\tMajorClaim 1729 1762\treading fictions is more pleasant\nT3\tClaim 1771 1861\tthese books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 235 278\tfiction books pay more attention to details\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 289 369\twe can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it\nT6\tPremise 371 490\tMost of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening\nT7\tPremise 505 646\tafter I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people\nT8\tPremise 657 728\ta movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 740 774\treading a novel is more convenient\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 776 857\tSome novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour\nT11\tPremise 859 963\tYet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains\nT12\tPremise 978 1024\tI have started to read a novel since last week\nT13\tPremise 1026 1141\tI do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class\nT14\tPremise 1156 1187\tI cannot watch a complete movie\nT15\tPremise 1196 1272\tI can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T9\t\nT16\tClaim 1303 1327\tpeople enjoy watching TV\nA4\tStance T16 Against\nT17\tPremise 1343 1416\tthey can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nT18\tPremise 1470 1530\tmovies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners\nR12\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tPremise 1537 1607\tcharacters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\nT20\tPremise 1609 1716\tFor these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T18\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Roles of international sports events\n\nWhenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.\nFirst and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.\nSecondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.\nIn conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 252 358\tpopular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely\nT2\tMajorClaim 2130 2293\tinternational sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely\nT3\tClaim 498 586\tthey can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 752 892\tsport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tClaim 2034 2113\tsport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 380 489\tsports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another\nT7\tPremise 596 666\ta large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events\nT8\tPremise 668 736\tthere are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures\nT9\tPremise 894 1105\tAfter sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations\nT10\tPremise 1117 1220\tsporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators\nT11\tPremise 1222 1304\tSeeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete\nT12\tPremise 1306 1424\tThe athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country\nT13\tPremise 1426 1540\tWhen witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness\nT14\tPremise 1556 1677\twhen Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets\nT15\tPremise 1679 1796\tPeople from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President\nT16\tPremise 1798 1840\tThe eager atmosphere lasted many next days\nT17\tPremise 1851 1946\tsome hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally\nT18\tPremise 1957 2001\tthe hooligans only took a minority of people\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T5\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T5\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T5\t\nR11\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T17 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Keep trying and never stop working for your goals\n\n\"Keep running!,\" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. \nFirstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. \nSecondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. \nThirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on.

{"prompt":"Government should regard investing in building roads as the most important\n\nThe population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.\nFirst and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.\nSecondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. \nLast but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.\nIn a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1961 2063\tthe advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable\nT2\tMajorClaim 250 326\tthe most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways\nT3\tClaim 381 479\twe all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 987 1084\tinvesting in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 481 606\tThe buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia\nT6\tPremise 618 676\tthe sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing\nT7\tPremise 696 743\tthere are many accidents happening on the roads\nT8\tPremise 758 835\tin my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents\nT9\tPremise 848 975\tVietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nT10\tPremise 1086 1162\tNot only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads\nT11\tPremise 1178 1270\tI always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home\nT12\tPremise 1272 1361\tIt is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour\nT13\tPremise 1376 1473\tif the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T4\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T4\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T4\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T4\t\nT14\tClaim 1496 1565\tspending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality\nA3\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1567 1639\tAll of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes\nT16\tPremise 1641 1732\tThose bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried\nT17\tPremise 1734 1787\tWe should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents\nT18\tPremise 1796 1851\ta part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nT19\tPremise 1853 1944\tWhat's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Advantages and disadvantages of the prevalent of English\n\nWith the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.\nSome people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.\nHowever, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.\nPersonally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications.

{"prompt":"Young adults preference on how long they should live with their parents before moving out\n\nAs young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.\nLiving on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.\nAnother advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.\nWhile some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. \nIn a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 339 410\tyoung adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time\nT2\tClaim 649 778\tliving with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 412 461\tLiving on your own is a huge financial commitment\nT4\tPremise 463 525\tAt younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job\nT5\tPremise 530 628\tIt can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tPremise 897 994\tParents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life\nT7\tPremise 996 1130\tLiving together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents\nT8\tPremise 1132 1301\tYoung adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents\nT9\tClaim 780 895\tAnother advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them\nA2\tStance T9 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tClaim 1338 1408\tyoung adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want\nA3\tStance T10 Against\nT11\tPremise 1434 1522\tmost young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have\nT12\tPremise 1524 1640\tIt is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nT13\tMajorClaim 1918 2173\tto cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time\nT14\tClaim 1673 1783\tyoung adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own\nA4\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1785 1910\tIt is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Whether it is better to have broad knowledge or not\n\nViews differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.\nFirst of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.\nSecond, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.\nAlthough I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.\nIn conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 512 577\thaving a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success\nT2\tClaim 631 716\twhen one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 1061 1107\tI have studied some of the engineering courses\nT4\tPremise 935 1053\tWhile some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T4\t\nT5\tPremise 1109 1257\tIt is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tPremise 1539 1635\tThanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art\nT7\tClaim 1267 1371\twhen you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1637 1768\tThings ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tClaim 1974 2057\tif one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed\nA3\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 2125 2194\twhat if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tMajorClaim 2481 2540\ta broad knowledge of different subjects is really important\n"}
{"prompt":"Traditional games or modern games in developing children's skills\n\nGames have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.\nIt is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.\nHowever, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.\nFurthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.\nThus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 414 486\tparents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games\nT2\tMajorClaim 2167 2272\ttraditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games\nT3\tClaim 2274 2375\tOnly through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 504 660\tmodern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend\nA2\tStance T4 Against\nT5\tPremise 678 860\tchildren have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future\nT6\tPremise 880 1019\tchildren have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nT7\tClaim 1038 1184\ttraditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1186 1276\tOne primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills\nT9\tPremise 1278 1485\tUnlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face\nT10\tPremise 1500 1587\tcommunicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT11\tClaim 1602 1683\tit is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today\nA4\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1694 1869\tthese traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices\nT13\tPremise 1884 1955\tmodern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits\nT14\tPremise 1968 2137\tthere is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T14\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Various local languages are becoming extinct \n\nToday, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.\nA world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.\nOn the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly.

{"prompt":"International tourism is now more common than ever before\n\nThe last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. \nFirstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.\nSecondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. \nTo conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 352 475\tit has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations\nT2\tMajorClaim 1568 1701\tinternational tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries\nT3\tClaim 955 1012\ttourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 487 613\tinternational tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists\nT5\tPremise 615 784\tTake Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores\nT6\tPremise 786 943\tThese demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard\nT7\tPremise 1024 1135\tthrough tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected\nT8\tClaim 1454 1526\ttourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1151 1329\tin Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry\nT10\tPremise 1331 1446\tWithout this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Sporting events easing international tensions, releasing patriotic feelings\n\nFor most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.\nFirstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.\nSecondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.\nIn conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 461 603\tlarge scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation\nT2\tMajorClaim 2175 2327\tit is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness\nT3\tClaim 1310 1413\tworld sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 772 964\tduring times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event\nT5\tPremise 979 1137\twhen Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers\nT6\tPremise 1163 1302\tinternational sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 1957 2059\tit is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1425 1512\tthese sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country\nT9\tPremise 1528 1700\twhen the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field\nT10\tPremise 1702 1794\tSouth African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night\nT11\tPremise 1796 1942\tThis example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nT12\tClaim 2329 2417\tThis has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future\nA3\tStance T12 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success\n\nAchieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.\nFirst, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.\nSecond, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.\nIn conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 391 456\tonce you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success\nT2\tClaim 701 872\tIf you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 899 977\twhen I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report\nT4\tPremise 986 1069\tI was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tPremise 465 584\tbeing positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others\nT6\tPremise 586 653\tAs living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game\nT7\tPremise 655 699\tOnly who has the sharpest weapon can survive\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nT8\tPremise 1345 1421\tTake the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example\nT9\tPremise 1423 1569\tThe reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors\nT11\tPremise 1571 1704\tIt has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers\nT10\tPremise 1706 1769\tIt is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tClaim 1079 1152\tbeing unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others\nA2\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1170 1343\tonce you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tMajorClaim 1786 1849\tbeing different and unique is the better way to achieve success\nT15\tClaim 1851 1970\tIt not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success\nA3\tStance T15 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Some students prefer to study alone\n\nEveryone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.\nStudying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.\nAdditionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. \nTo conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group.

Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people.

The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. \nComputers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind.

{"prompt":"Lessons with teachers versus others sources\n\nOver the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.\nMany people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.\nThose who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.\nPersonally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source.

{"prompt":"International tourism is now more common than ever before\n\nThe last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.\nFirstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.\nSecondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 262 376\tthis industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations\nT2\tMajorClaim 1663 1758\tthe tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments\nT3\tClaim 179 239\tthe tourism bring large profit for the destination countries\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tClaim 953 1031\tinternational tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tClaim 1578 1624\ttourism has threatened the nature environments\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 417 530\ttourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations\nT7\tPremise 532 818\tTake Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits\nT8\tPremise 820 924\tThis was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism\nT9\tPremise 1074 1158\ttourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals\nT10\tPremise 1160 1413\tAs the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions\nT11\tPremise 1432 1550\tmany marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T5\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T5\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Zoos should be banned\n\nChildren tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.\nThere is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.\nAdditionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.\nOn the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.\nIn order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals.

{"prompt":"Living in a higher pace is better\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. \nApart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. \nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 426 469\tI prefer to live in a higher pace condition\nT2\tMajorClaim 2031 2064\tliving in a higher pace is better\nT3\tClaim 2073 2147\tthe advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tMajorClaim 2165 2194\tI prefer to live in high pace\nT5\tPremise 535 672\twe need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam\nT6\tClaim 938 970\twe have to be eager in our lives\nA3\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 674 734\tI just failed to participate in the university entrance exam\nT8\tPremise 743 898\tI thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test\nT9\tPremise 1052 1115\tkeeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy\nT10\tPremise 1117 1224\tIf I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully\nT11\tPremise 1240 1373\tI had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing\nT12\tClaim 1428 1464\tkeeping our pace higher is important\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tClaim 1542 1587\twith a slower pace can enjoy their lives more\nA2\tStance T13 Against\nT14\tPremise 1596 1682\tit is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed\nT15\tPremise 1769 1867\tI do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy\nT16\tPremise 1882 1972\tit is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T12\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Why are groups or organizations important to people?\n\nDuring our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:\nIn the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.\nBy participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.\nFurthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. \nFor the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 2419 2534\tgroups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds\nT2\tMajorClaim 240 310\tgroups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals\nT4\tClaim 1087 1133\talmost of us live in the environment of groups\nA1\tStance T4 For\nT5\tClaim 464 554\tthe groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults\nT6\tPremise 556 717\tWe begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life\nT7\tPremise 719 804\tBy making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others\nT8\tPremise 806 959\tAs university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others\nT9\tPremise 961 1079\tAfter graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits\nT10\tClaim 1135 1254\tBy participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose\nA2\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1256 1368\tA solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons\nT12\tPremise 1383 1476\tas a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year\nT13\tPremise 1478 1610\tWhen being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term\nT14\tPremise 1623 1718\tit is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job\nT15\tClaim 1733 1812\tgroups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal\nA3\tStance T15 For\nT16\tPremise 1876 2012\tTzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care\nT17\tPremise 2014 2076\tThey bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit\nT18\tPremise 2078 2202\tFor accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks\nT19\tPremise 2275 2348\tthey could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world\nT20\tPremise 2217 2260\tthey lit the light for the poor and victims\nT3\tPremise 366 449\thumans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups\nA4\tStance T5 For\nT21\tPremise 1834 1874\tthere are various charities in the world\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T20\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T20\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T15\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T15\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T15\t\n"}
{"prompt":"A university plans to devlope a new research centre in your country\n\nMost of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.\nFirst of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.\nSecondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.\nAnother reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. \nSome people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field.

{"prompt":"Schools should only teach children the academic subject\n\nPeople have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.\nMany people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. \nAlthough those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation.

{"prompt":"Improving facilities is the best way\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. \nMoreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.\nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. \nBased on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 526 573\tI prefer to spend money on improving facilities\nT2\tMajorClaim 2212 2259\timproving facilities is the best way for school\nT3\tClaim 2268 2336\tthe advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 2354 2413\tstudents can procure more advantages from better facilities\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 638 722\tthe more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge\nT6\tClaim 1053 1098\tcertain facilities are beneficial to students\nA3\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 737 794\tlibrary is a good place for students to study or research\nT8\tPremise 796 918\tThey can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize\nT9\tPremise 920 1010\tWith this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T6\t\nT10\tPremise 1150 1195\tstudents are not always staying in classrooms\nT11\tClaim 1596 1660\tstudents would prefer school to spending on improving facilities\nA4\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1197 1236\tThey have numerous activities in school\nT13\tPremise 1238 1329\tConsider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school\nT14\tPremise 1331 1408\tHe must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance\nT15\tPremise 1410 1540\tWith this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T11\t\nT16\tClaim 1737 1794\tschools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers\nA5\tStance T16 Against\nT17\tPremise 1803 1838\tthey can impart their students well\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nT18\tPremise 1957 2066\tA student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study\nR11\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tPremise 2068 2154\tIt is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards\nR12\tattacks Arg1:T19 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"University education should be only available for good students\n\nThe purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.\nFirst, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.\nSecondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.\nTo sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 309 419\tit should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners\nT2\tMajorClaim 1944 2082\teveryone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students\nT3\tClaim 2084 2202\tThis will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 428 481\tfocusing only on talented students is a better option\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 490 558\tit helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality\nT6\tPremise 560 715\tUnlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge\nT7\tPremise 726 840\tsome students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones\nT8\tPremise 842 960\tThat explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions\nT9\tPremise 968 1045\tthey need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nT10\tClaim 1057 1100\tuniversity should only accept good students\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1109 1167\tit gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 1192 1296\tthis may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs'\nR7\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nT13\tPremise 1311 1350\tit gives no harm to the whole community\nR8\tattacks Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT14\tPremise 1352 1522\tThose standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT15\tPremise 1532 1614\tlimiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice\nT16\tPremise 1621 1774\tit will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves\nT17\tPremise 1788 1912\tthis improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T15\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Communicating via e-mail and voice mail vs Telephone and face-to face\n\nAlthough many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.\nFirstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.\nSecondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.\nThirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.\nAnd finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.\nTo sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 169 218\tcommunicating by e-mails or voice mails is better\nT2\tPremise 437 516\tIn this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail\nT3\tPremise 525 571\teven shy people feel themselves more confident\nT4\tClaim 321 352\tcommunicating by e-mail is easy\nA1\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 354 435\tMany people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with\nT6\tPremise 828 916\tI might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time\nT7\tPremise 920 961\tfor me it is better to leave a voice mail\nT8\tPremise 721 826\tI get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems\nT9\tPremise 642 719\tI work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day\nT10\tClaim 583 629\tyou can write an e-mail at any time of the day\nA2\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1125 1216\tyou can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite\nT12\tPremise 1218 1323\tWhen you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail\nT13\tClaim 972 1110\twhen you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself\nA3\tStance T13 For\nT14\tClaim 1338 1400\tthere is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail\nA4\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1402 1490\tYou should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business\nT16\tMajorClaim 1631 1693\tI would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\n"}

It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.\nTo begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage.

{"prompt":"Government should be responsible for education and health care or not?\n\nDespite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.\nSome people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.\nOn the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.\nPersonally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas.

{"prompt":"Leisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors.\n\nPeople often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.\nThere are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. \nOutdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. \nMoreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.\nAdmittedly, indoor activities are fun.

{"prompt":"Should the cost of medicines be reduced?\n\nAt present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.\nAdmittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.\nHowever, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.\nFortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.\nIn conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1719 1803\tI disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities\nT2\tClaim 727 798\tThe reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 630 725\tIf people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better\nT4\tPremise 327 385\tmore lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines\nT5\tPremise 387 476\tThe medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs\nT6\tPremise 478 628\tWith advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT7\tClaim 1381 1430\tthere are other measures to improve the situation\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 1432 1570\tIt is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes\nT9\tPremise 1586 1702\tcharitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nT10\tClaim 809 905\tthe current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 919 1020\tthe process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money\nT12\tPremise 1032 1086\tthese products prove to ensure human health completely\nT13\tClaim 1241 1322\tthe measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation\nA4\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1088 1228\tSuppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"It is not necessary for university students to attend classes\n\nThough out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. \nFirstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.\nSecondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.\nAdmittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.\nAll in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 400 482\tstudents can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam\nT2\tMajorClaim 2121 2215\tthe university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test\nT3\tClaim 2224 2359\tnot only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 637 661\tI don't like electronics\nT5\tPremise 671 722\telectronics cannot always be seen in the real world\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tClaim 537 602\tthe students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 724 786\tAnd I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics\nT8\tPremise 788 861\tBut I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics\nT9\tPremise 863 1025\tAnd if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again\nT10\tPremise 1027 1115\tLuckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach\nT11\tPremise 1117 1180\tAnd I can study physics without consideration of my electronics\nT12\tPremise 1182 1241\tAnd at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T6\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T6\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T6\t\nT13\tClaim 1874 2023\tthe university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not\nA3\tStance T13 Against\nT14\tPremise 2029 2107\tthe benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tClaim 1253 1392\tif the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated\nA4\tStance T15 For\nT16\tPremise 1394 1489\tIf one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes\nT17\tPremise 1491 1545\tAnd the students will have nothing to do in the campus\nT18\tPremise 1552 1600\the or she will play online games days and nights\nT19\tPremise 1602 1639\tThe academic achievement will decline\nT20\tPremise 1653 1698\tthis student will become a loser in the world\nT21\tPremise 1700 1780\tAnd all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class\nT22\tPremise 1782 1860\tThis is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T15\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T15\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T20 Arg2:T15\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T15\t\nR15\tsupports Arg1:T21 Arg2:T15\t\nR16\tsupports Arg1:T22 Arg2:T15\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Most difficult experiences will become valuable lessons\n\nThere is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.\nTo start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.\nWhat's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.\nSo, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 399 474\tsome tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path\nT2\tClaim 839 934\texperiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 491 670\thardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc\nT4\tPremise 672 824\tPeople who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end\nT5\tPremise 1111 1184\tthey are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens\nT6\tPremise 1043 1109\tthey already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties\nT7\tPremise 1186 1257\tThose people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career\nT8\tPremise 1266 1378\tthey are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way\nT9\tClaim 949 1033\tpeople who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles\nA2\tStance T9 For\nT10\tMajorClaim 1514 1595\tmost tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\n"}

One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.\nFirst of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.\nAnother way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.\nFinally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. \nAs I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 249 312\tTelevision has destroyed communication among friends and family\nT2\tClaim 314 449\tSome People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 1807 1882\ttelevision is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening\nA2\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tMajorClaim 1901 2072\ttelevision has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television\nT5\tPremise 866 929\tshe is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email\nT6\tPremise 760 860\tSometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nT7\tPremise 518 603\tInstead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours\nT8\tPremise 931 1034\tTime with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them\nT9\tPremise 605 758\tI know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours\nT10\tClaim 465 516\tsome people spend a lot of time watching television\nA3\tStance T10 For\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T10\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T10\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T10\t\nT11\tPremise 1170 1283\tThis is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns\nT12\tPremise 1291 1372\twhen there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation\nT13\tPremise 1381 1420\tthe television is again in between them\nT14\tPremise 1422 1538\tWhen family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases\nT15\tClaim 1036 1168\tAnother way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family\nA4\tStance T15 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T15\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T15\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tClaim 1549 1591\tsome people make the television a priority\nA5\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 1593 1731\tI remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\n"}

Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.\nFirst of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible.

A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.\nFinally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders.

{"prompt":"Discuss both harms and good of advertising and give your opinion\n\nOn these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.\nOn the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. \nOn the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising.

{"prompt":"Drugs, alcohol and messy sex lives\n\nCelebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.\nThe first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.\nMeanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.\nOf course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.\nIn conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 367 429\tthis is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children\nT2\tMajorClaim 1323 1390\tmedia should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere\nT3\tClaim 527 645\tThis gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 431 525\tThe first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 661 737\tthey will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tPremise 787 951\tIt is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives\nT7\tClaim 966 1073\twithout proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living\nA2\tStance T7 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 750 785\tnot all celebrities are role models\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tClaim 1086 1172\tsome celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1177 1306\tthey share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"How teachers can make the subject interesting to students!\n\nThere are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.\nFirst of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.\nSecond, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.\nIn conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 340 491\tthe best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school\nT2\tMajorClaim 1977 2137\tusing life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning\nT3\tClaim 2156 2276\tit reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 507 697\tby explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 699 1000\tTake chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class\nT6\tPremise 1002 1204\tWhile I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas\nT7\tPremise 1206 1282\tThis type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good\nT8\tPremise 1284 1421\tI connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 1431 1592\tby bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1594 1631\tThis will address students' interests\nT11\tPremise 1640 1694\tit's the assignment that needs real life participation\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 1709 1863\tin law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them\nT13\tPremise 1865 1960\tWhen any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Part time job for teenage students\n\nWhen we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he\/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.\nThe main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.\nAnother reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.\nIn sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 327 406\tit is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he\/she is still a student\nT2\tMajorClaim 2017 2056\tpart time job will be good for students\nT3\tClaim 1863 1904\tit can destruct students from their study\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 1918 1994\ti did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 546 639\tStudents can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words\nT6\tPremise 654 727\twhen I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year\nT7\tPremise 785 820\ti had to manage my time efficiently\nT8\tPremise 729 772\tAs i had to spend some of my time in my job\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tPremise 822 883\tI had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework\nT10\tPremise 885 969\tThis taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively\nT11\tPremise 981 1005\tI learn money management\nT12\tPremise 1007 1089\tWhen my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nT13\tPremise 1091 1141\tFrom this i learned, how to manage money correctly\nT14\tPremise 1143 1228\tThis experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things\nT15\tClaim 460 544\tstudents can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job\nA2\tStance T15 For\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T15\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T6\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T6\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T6\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T15\t\nT16\tClaim 1253 1326\tfrom part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents\nA3\tStance T16 For\nT17\tPremise 1674 1761\tpart time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially\nT18\tPremise 1499 1564\tBy tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it\nT19\tPremise 1576 1656\tafter taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T16\t\nR14\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of arts\n\nThe issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.\nFirst of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.\nOn top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.\nFurthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. \nTo sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 350 429\tthis investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society\nT2\tMajorClaim 1681 1796\tit would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways\nT3\tClaim 1596 1670\tnot only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind\nA1\tStance T3 Against\nT4\tPremise 796 959\tThere is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts\nT5\tClaim 977 1043\tthe arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society\nA3\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 1045 1178\tNo developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration\nT7\tPremise 1180 1313\tEnriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tClaim 1328 1429\tinvesting in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally\nA4\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1431 1582\tThe investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tClaim 468 591\tgovernments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way\nT11\tPremise 605 717\tno one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication\nT12\tPremise 728 794\tthese could only help individuals with their physical requirements\nA5\tStance T10 Against\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR5\tattacks Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR6\tattacks Arg1:T4 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"High sum of money of modern artist\n\nThe amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.\nProficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric \"I swear\" become \"underwear\" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.\nStriking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing \"I swear\" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.\nHaving said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job.

{"prompt":"Do modern communication technologies benefit all people\n\nModern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.\nTo begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.\nNevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.\nBy way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 364 405\tthere are valid arguments to the contrary\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nT2\tMajorClaim 428 550\tthe majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication\nT3\tMajorClaim 1794 1896\tmodern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases\nT4\tClaim 1132 1214\tthese new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 567 718\tmobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business\nT6\tPremise 720 841\tWith the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds\nT7\tPremise 856 966\tit is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world\nT8\tPremise 968 1105\tWith a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tClaim 1658 1755\tpeople who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies\nT10\tPremise 1281 1331\tthe more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits\nT11\tPremise 1361 1472\tthe wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money\nT12\tPremise 1474 1642\tAnyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nA3\tStance T9 Against\n"}
{"prompt":"Qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs\n\nWith the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. \nFirstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. \nOn the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.\nTo my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1594 1686\tqualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs\nT2\tClaim 1693 1885\tthe importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tClaim 504 589\tqualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 591 690\tIt is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job\nT5\tPremise 706 826\tpeople who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience\nT6\tPremise 828 921\tSocial skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tPremise 1361 1417\torganization have been transformed to customers oriented\nT8\tPremise 1419 1559\tExcellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction\nT9\tClaim 963 1049\tthe importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers\nA3\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 1065 1136\tpeople nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently\nT11\tPremise 1138 1265\tInterpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise\nT12\tPremise 1267 1350\tBetter social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy\n\nThe increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.\nFirstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.\nSecondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.\nTo conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1340 1425\tit would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy\nT2\tClaim 1427 1525\tThis can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 834 935\tit would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 346 387\tthe major source of energy today is water\nT5\tPremise 398 500\tthere is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source\nT6\tPremise 502 576\tTo generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short\nT7\tPremise 584 672\tduring summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nT8\tPremise 674 821\tIf the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T3\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T3\t\nT9\tClaim 947 1089\tthe sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1104 1201\tthe use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming\nT11\tPremise 1220 1325\tthe use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants\n\nGenerally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.\nFirst of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. \nSecondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.\nLast but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.\nIn conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 421 498\tsmoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants\nT2\tClaim 507 557\tit will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tClaim 655 738\tSmoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals\nA2\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 573 653\trestaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals\nT5\tPremise 740 819\tThey will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tClaim 1001 1062\tSmoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children\nA3\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 832 899\trestaurants are places that people usually come with their families\nT8\tPremise 913 999\tthere will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants\nT9\tPremise 1064 1120\tChildren have a high potential to imitate what adults do\nT10\tPremise 1129 1178\tthey have really high curiosity towards something\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tClaim 1180 1299\tSmoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs\nA4\tStance T11 For\nT12\tPremise 1301 1381\tThe most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women\nT13\tPremise 1390 1476\tthey will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T6\t\nT14\tClaim 1745 1777\tit is unfair for passive smokers\nA5\tStance T14 For\nT15\tPremise 1786 1853\tthey do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nT16\tPremise 1498 1545\tpassive smokers will have a lot of health risks\nT17\tPremise 1547 1620\tWhen they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke\nT18\tPremise 1622 1722\tStroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T14\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nT19\tMajorClaim 1870 1916\tsmoking should not be permitted in restaurants\nT20\tClaim 1925 1972\tthere will be a lot of people get disadvantaged\nA6\tStance T20 For\n"}
{"prompt":"Advanced fertilizers and machine for farmers, good or bad?\n\nIn recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.\nAdmittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.\nHowever, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.\nMoreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.\nIn conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tClaim 1765 1857\tnewly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers\nA1\tStance T1 Against\nT2\tMajorClaim 1881 1977\tthe demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked\nT3\tPremise 437 552\tapplying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit\nT4\tPremise 570 740\tartificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest\nT5\tClaim 756 854\tthe production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased\nA3\tStance T5 Against\nT6\tClaim 865 944\thigh-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being\nA4\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 946 1158\tUnlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently\nT8\tPremise 1174 1287\tconsumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\nT9\tClaim 1299 1396\texcessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society\nA5\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 1398 1482\tOne is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission\nT11\tPremise 1497 1549\tmanual harvest prevents severe environmental damages\nT12\tPremise 1564 1646\tmechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry\nT13\tPremise 1665 1736\thigh-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\n"}

The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.\nMoreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the \"calm before the storm\".

{"prompt":"Jury must have access to criminals' past records\n\nIt is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.\nFirst and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.\nApart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.\nIt is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.\nTo conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 301 392\tthe juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion\nT2\tMajorClaim 2045 2186\tthe current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with\nT3\tClaim 2228 2319\tthey will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 550 661\tit would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 680 791\tknowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment\nT6\tPremise 807 883\ttake a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty\nT7\tPremise 885 1035\tThe juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person\nT8\tPremise 1043 1097\tpunishment can be given in accordance to the condition\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nT9\tPremise 1245 1421\texposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision\nT10\tPremise 1436 1549\tthe juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences\nT11\tClaim 1566 1611\tthe convicted will also receive a fair action\nT12\tPremise 1165 1237\tjuries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law\nT13\tPremise 1116 1144\ta fair trial can be achieved\nA4\tStance T11 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T11\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T11\t\nT14\tClaim 1635 1765\twhen the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized\nA5\tStance T14 Against\nT15\tPremise 1767 1843\tIf finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public\nT16\tPremise 1869 2007\tthe crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR12\tattacks Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T11\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Higher school students should be taught how to manage money\n\nThere is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.\nThe reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.\nIn addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.\nIn conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 478 545\thigher school students should be made aware of the money management\nT2\tMajorClaim 1791 1898\tstudents understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact\nT3\tPremise 648 930\twhen secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence\nT4\tPremise 945 1183\twhile I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses\nT5\tClaim 570 633\tteenage students need to understand the money management basics\nA1\tStance T5 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T5\t\nT6\tPremise 1198 1414\tif financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized\nT7\tPremise 1429 1526\tbuying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background\nT8\tPremise 1537 1631\tfor a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour\nT9\tClaim 1640 1766\thaving exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently\nA3\tStance T9 For\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"More people are migrating to other countries than ever before\n\nThe last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.\nFirstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.\nSecondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home.

{"prompt":"The popularity of news media\n\nNowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.\nFirst and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.\nIn addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.\nIn conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects.

{"prompt":"Successful people do something new or take risks\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.\nThe first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.\nMoreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.\nAdmittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 493 544\tsuccessful people still do things they already know\nT2\tMajorClaim 2391 2448\tdoing what we already known can still leads us to succeed\nT3\tClaim 2457 2528\tthe advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 608 674\tto be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter\nT5\tPremise 676 762\tThe lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own\nT6\tPremise 764 865\tConsider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment\nT7\tPremise 867 999\tHe can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income\nT8\tPremise 1001 1122\tHe does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time\nT9\tClaim 1165 1226\tsuccessful people do not have to try new things or take risks\nA3\tStance T9 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T9\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T9\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T9\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T9\t\nT10\tClaim 1836 1891\tit is not necessary for successful people to take risks\nA2\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1277 1352\tit depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not\nT12\tPremise 1364 1450\ta successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success\nT13\tPremise 1466 1562\tthe sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills\nT14\tPremise 1564 1661\tThe same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm\nT15\tPremise 1676 1780\tthose athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T10\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT16\tClaim 1973 2027\tdoing something new is necessary for people to success\nA4\tStance T16 Against\nT17\tPremise 2036 2123\tthey can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success\nT18\tPremise 2242 2297\tTry something new can indeed make people become special\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T16\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T16\t\nT19\tPremise 2299 2332\twhile it does not mean successful\nR13\tattacks Arg1:T19 Arg2:T18\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Capital punishment - necessary or not\n\nCrime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.\nCapital punishment is given only in the \"rarest of the rare\" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.\nMoreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.\nImportantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.\nHowever, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.\nCapital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 252 316\tstrict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society\nT2\tMajorClaim 1667 1733\tCapital punishment is essential to control violence in the society\nT3\tMajorClaim 1757 1869\tpsychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment\nT4\tClaim 1871 1954\tCapital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner\nA1\tStance T4 For\nT5\tClaim 589 652\tcapital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 452 581\tWhen a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment\nT7\tPremise 318 384\tCapital punishment is given only in the \"rarest of the rare\" cases\nT8\tPremise 386 450\tIts first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings\nT9\tClaim 847 902\tthe rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 664 742\tcapital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes\nT11\tPremise 744 839\tWhen a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T5\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T9\t\nT12\tPremise 917 1028\tcapital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals\nT13\tClaim 1030 1162\tCriminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment\nA5\tStance T13 For\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nT15\tClaim 1270 1366\tThey can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals\nA6\tStance T15 Against\nT14\tPremise 1173 1216\tthe jury giving the verdict are also humans\nT16\tPremise 1218 1268\tThey have the life of a person at their discretion\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T15\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nT17\tPremise 1368 1450\tThe jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime\nT18\tPremise 1465 1548\tif an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous\nT19\tPremise 1550 1665\tOnly deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T15\t\n"}

Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth.

In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a \"new\" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.\nBesides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people.

Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.\nFirst, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.\nSecond, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.\nThird, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people.

{"prompt":"Is a break good or bad after high school for students\n\nStudies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.\nIn most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.\nNevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.\nHowever, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.\nImportantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 267 345\ta break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school\nT2\tMajorClaim 2104 2205\ta break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies\nT3\tClaim 2009 2096\tthe sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 648 750\ta break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 765 890\twhen students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge\nT6\tPremise 443 521\tA relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change\nT7\tPremise 523 634\tA continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tClaim 1000 1100\tWorking or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1102 1163\tIt will also help them to learn professional setup by working\nT10\tPremise 1165 1263\tFinancially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job\nT11\tPremise 1265 1352\tSome students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nT12\tClaim 1393 1456\tA break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental\nA4\tStance T12 Against\nT13\tPremise 1765 1830\tStudents can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time\nT14\tPremise 1458 1598\tWhen students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia\nT15\tPremise 1614 1702\tmy cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT16\tPremise 1704 1763\tWhen he started his university studies, he failed miserably\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T14\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nT17\tPremise 1947 1994\tA break gives students more benefits than harms\nR10\tattacks Arg1:T17 Arg2:T12\t\nT18\tPremise 1876 1945\tIt varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period\nR11\tattacks Arg1:T18 Arg2:T12\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Should teachers be paid according to how much their students learn?\n\nEveryone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.\nTo begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.\nSecond, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.\nLastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.\nIn conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class.

{"prompt":"Salary is the most important consideration when choosing a job\n\nAlong with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.\nOn one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.\nOn the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers.

{"prompt":"Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not?\n\nLiving in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.\nIn terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.\nAdditionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.\nOn the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.\nTherefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 523 601\ttechnology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles\nT3\tClaim 603 730\tIn terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 1044 1211\twith the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere\nT5\tPremise 732 843\tIn the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles\nT6\tPremise 845 1033\tThis means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 1227 1334\ttechnology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT2\tPremise 1349 1521\tChina has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens\nT8\tPremise 1532 1649\tmany tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T2 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT9\tClaim 1670 1771\tsome people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles\nA4\tStance T9 Against\nT10\tPremise 1797 1942\tespecially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nT11\tPremise 1988 2061\tpeople tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years\nR9\tattacks Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tMajorClaim 2095 2193\ttechnology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Every student either male or female should be given equal opportunity\n \nIn today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. \nTo begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. \nFurthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. \nIn conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 238 364\tthere should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses\nT2\tClaim 470 607\tjudging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 619 758\tboth male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education\nT4\tPremise 760 915\tIn India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT5\tClaim 931 1112\tfemale students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 1127 1356\tdue to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure\nT7\tPremise 1371 1536\tChanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nT8\tMajorClaim 1592 1829\tevery student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender\n"}
{"prompt":"Apartments vs dormitories at university\n\nMany students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.\nFirst, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.\nSecond, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.\nLastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times.

{"prompt":"Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places\n\nSmoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.\nFirst of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he\/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.\nFurthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. \nLastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. \nTo conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tPremise 2436 2503\tIt spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health\nT2\tMajorClaim 2516 2652\tit is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it\nT3\tClaim 2370 2434\tsmoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior\nA1\tStance T3 For\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T1 Arg2:T3\t\nT4\tMajorClaim 247 371\tsmoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it\nT5\tClaim 380 488\tsmoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT7\tPremise 730 872\tthe second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself\nT8\tClaim 1154 1202\tsmoking in restaurants should be strictly banned\nA4\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1211 1291\tit makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nT10\tPremise 887 1010\tif there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked\nT11\tPremise 1028 1141\tsome burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he\/she inhales it\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nT12\tPremise 513 697\tit is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T8\t\nT6\tClaim 1403 1537\tthe disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nT13\tPremise 1539 1678\tThe smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals\nT14\tPremise 1680 1756\tThis, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity\nT15\tPremise 1765 1842\tfewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T14\t\nA5\tStance T6 For\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T6\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T6\t\nT16\tPremise 1897 2036\tNot only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation\nT17\tPremise 2149 2217\tmost people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior\nT18\tPremise 2038 2139\tThis is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T18\t\nT19\tPremise 2234 2354\tthe public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader\nT20\tClaim 1853 1895\tsmoking does no good to the smoker himself\nA3\tStance T20 For\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T20\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T20\t\nR13\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T20\t\n"}
{"prompt":"A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues\n\nIn today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.\nThe first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.\nThe second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.\nIn conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 274 387\tgovernments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions\nT2\tMajorClaim 1619 1812\ta greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being\nT3\tClaim 736 796\tsociety should be educated and became aware of health issues\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 805 944\tthe potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nT5\tPremise 541 723\tdecreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT6\tClaim 1233 1388\ta government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives\nA2\tStance T6 For\nT7\tPremise 1112 1220\tthere is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T6\t\nT8\tPremise 1403 1602\tthe marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T6\t\n"}
{"prompt":"People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology\n\nThe life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.\nThe first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.\nSecond, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.\nThe third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.\nIn conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority.

{"prompt":"Opinions regarding world culture\n\nThere are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.\nFirstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.\nSecondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.\nSome people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them.

{"prompt":"Creativity - should it be given freedom or restrictions\n\nCreativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.\nTime and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.\nNonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.\nUnfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, \"Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.\nHowever, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 225 315\tcreative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions\nT2\tClaim 180 216\tCreativity originates in a free mind\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1786 1835\tartists should be given the freedom of expression\nT4\tClaim 619 692\tCreative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 317 464\tTime and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message\nT6\tPremise 466 617\tRight from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT7\tClaim 707 804\tinnovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience\nA3\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 806 880\tIt helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments\nT9\tPremise 896 1014\tBangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue\nT10\tPremise 1016 1077\tThis type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds\nT11\tPremise 1092 1129\tcreativity also gives aesthetic charm\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T8\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T7\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT12\tClaim 1364 1450\tLike the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely\nA4\tStance T12 For\nT13\tPremise 1185 1267\tFrank Zappa once said, \"Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“\nT14\tPremise 1269 1362\tRestrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T12\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T12\t\nT15\tClaim 1837 1887\tMind can not work when it is chained in boundaries\nA5\tStance T15 For\nT16\tClaim 1889 2001\tImagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws\nA6\tStance T16 For\nT17\tClaim 1650 1762\tArtists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose\nA7\tStance T17 For\nT18\tPremise 1461 1526\tartists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people\nT19\tPremise 1528 1648\tMany artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T18 Arg2:T17\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T19 Arg2:T17\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Children are free\n\nYou hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.\nIn the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.\nIn addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life.

{"prompt":"Can technology alone solve the world's environmental problems?\n\nIt is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.\nSome people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.\nOn the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.\nThere are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.\nTo put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1955 2016\ttechnology alone can solve the world's environmental problems\nT2\tClaim 459 558\tif humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment\nA1\tStance T2 Against\nT3\tPremise 576 635\tit is the luxuries people use which damages the environment\nT4\tPremise 637 880\tIf people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment\nT5\tClaim 930 973\ttechnology alone could save the environment\nA2\tStance T5 For\nT6\tPremise 991 1062\tnow we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back\nT7\tPremise 1064 1145\tWe cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart\nT8\tClaim 1147 1234\tThere are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot\nA3\tStance T8 For\nT9\tPremise 1236 1331\tOne prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa\nT10\tPremise 1333 1509\tBy pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource\nT11\tPremise 1524 1592\tJapan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030\nT12\tPremise 1594 1743\tBy drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions\nT13\tPremise 1745 1803\tIf successful, the impact on the world would be monumental\nT14\tPremise 1805 1859\tIt would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes\nT15\tPremise 1861 1904\tIt would mean another industrial revolution\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T5\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T5\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T8\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T8\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T8\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T8\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T13\t\n"}

{"prompt":"The importance of games for adults comparing to children\n\nAs people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.\nThe first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.\nAnother reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.\nTo sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 218 260\tgames are no longer too important for them\nT2\tMajorClaim 1733 1867\tadults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable\nT3\tClaim 1869 2033\tAlong with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tClaim 307 367\tgames become unnecessary for people when their careers begin\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 369 448\tSomeone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life\nR1\tattacks Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nT6\tPremise 455 554\tmore often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies\nT7\tPremise 573 671\tthey cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T7\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nT8\tPremise 686 836\tin my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job\nT9\tPremise 838 930\tThey often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T4\t\nT10\tClaim 975 1092\tadults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning\nA3\tStance T10 For\nT11\tPremise 1094 1234\tFor youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not\nT12\tPremise 1249 1390\tmy younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt\nT13\tPremise 1411 1485\tadults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately\nT14\tPremise 1496 1584\ta competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues\nT15\tPremise 1603 1712\tthey no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T10\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T10\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T10\t\n"}
{"prompt":"What is a very important skill a person should learn\n\nSome people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. \nStress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.\nIn the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.\nFurthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.\nFor the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 1939 2045\tstress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress\nT2\tMajorClaim 179 283\tstress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have\nT3\tClaim 613 699\tif we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems\nA1\tStance T3 For\nT4\tPremise 307 413\tStress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences\nT5\tPremise 415 473\tStress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success\nT6\tPremise 484 598\tit is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T3\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T3\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T3\t\nT7\tClaim 1146 1224\tstress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization\nT8\tPremise 933 1040\tSome people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT9\tPremise 1042 1133\tother people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT10\tPremise 701 931\tIn the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T7\t\nT11\tPremise 1446 1512\tsome people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches\nT12\tPremise 1514 1591\tMelancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide\nT13\tClaim 1607 1712\tit is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body\nA3\tStance T13 For\nT14\tPremise 1239 1272\tstress takes a toll on our health\nT15\tPremise 1365 1438\tThis is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress\nT16\tPremise 1274 1363\tIt is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T11\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T11\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T13\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T13\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T13\t\n"}
{"prompt":"The ability to relate well to people is more important\n\nI think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:\nWe need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.\nOne of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. \nIn sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 215 326\tboth the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job\nT2\tClaim 1812 1845\teach of them has its own benefits\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tMajorClaim 1771 1803\twe should notice to both of them\nT4\tClaim 856 922\tstudying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job\nA2\tStance T4 For\nT5\tPremise 562 658\tIf we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future\nT6\tPremise 350 421\tWe need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job\nT7\tPremise 451 560\tIn school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them\nT8\tPremise 673 838\tif someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job\t\nT9\tClaim 1541 1597\trelating well to people is also another important factor\nA3\tStance T9 For\nT10\tPremise 924 1003\tOne of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation\nT11\tPremise 1005 1071\tBy relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends\nT12\tPremise 1086 1130\twe will have a wide network of communication\nT13\tPremise 1132 1169\tCommuincation can bring many benefits\nT14\tPremise 1184 1283\tif you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well\nT15\tPremise 1298 1349\tthey respect you as well, you can achieve your goal\nT16\tPremise 1355 1535\tif you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers\nT17\tPremise 423 449\tThis can be done in school\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T4\t\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T7 Arg2:T4\t\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T17 Arg2:T4\t\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T4\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T11 Arg2:T12\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T12 Arg2:T9\t\nR8\tsupports Arg1:T14 Arg2:T15\t\nR9\tsupports Arg1:T15 Arg2:T9\t\nR10\tsupports Arg1:T16 Arg2:T9\t\nR11\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR12\tsupports Arg1:T13 Arg2:T9\t\n"}
{"prompt":"Physical exercise should be required part of every school day\n\nAlthough some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.\nPhysical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.\nDaily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.\nHaving children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. \nIncluding physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered.

{"prompt":"Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways\n\nIt is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.\nFirstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.\nSecondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. \nThirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result.

{"prompt":"Some prefer to work for a company, some prefer to work for themselves\n\nThere are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. \nIn the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.\nWhat is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.\nFinally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.\nThere is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable.

{"prompt":"Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their olde\n\nIt might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.\nIn the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.\nMoreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.\nTo sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" T1\tMajorClaim 251 324\tteenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages\nT2\tClaim 494 538\tthey are the best advisor for their children\nA1\tStance T2 For\nT3\tPremise 411 482\tparents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children\nR1\tsupports Arg1:T3 Arg2:T2\t\nT4\tPremise 610 685\tif children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things\nT5\tPremise 540 605\tThey have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life\nR2\tsupports Arg1:T5 Arg2:T4\t\nR3\tsupports Arg1:T4 Arg2:T2\t\nT6\tPremise 693 795\tthey can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way\nR4\tsupports Arg1:T6 Arg2:T2\t\nT7\tClaim 835 915\tparents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers\nA2\tStance T7 For\nT8\tPremise 925 1028\tunfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money\nT9\tPremise 1030 1051\tThey cheat young ages\nT10\tPremise 1060 1120\tthey believe they are immature and they can trap them easily\nR5\tsupports Arg1:T10 Arg2:T9\t\nR6\tsupports Arg1:T9 Arg2:T7\t\nR7\tsupports Arg1:T8 Arg2:T7\t\nT11\tMajorClaim 1302 1380\tit is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice\n"}
{"prompt":"Concentrate on the objectives - people attend schools for various reasons\n\nFrom many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views.

Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.\nSecondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world.

Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are.
